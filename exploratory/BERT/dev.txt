Dr. O

However, O
per O
Mr. O

he O
arrived O
to O
the O

only O
with O
the O
expectation O
of O
discussing O
his O

refilling O
his O

which O
he O
has O
been O

Dr. O
Prince O
documents O
a O

in O
which O
the O
pt O
was O
tearful O
and O
emotional, O
while O
describing O
active O
suicidal O

with O
a O
plan O
to O

on O
oxycodone. O
He O
reportedly O
had O
several O

where O
he O
had O
more O
than O
a O

in O
his O

did O
not O

does O
admit O

of O
the O

and O
strong O

However, O
he O
states O
that O
his O
last O
suicidal O

was O
approximately O
2 O

and O
that O
he O
changed O
his O

once O
he O
realized O
his O
mother&#8217;s O
soon-to-be O
ex-husband, O
who O
has O

threatening O
her, O
will O
be O
released O

Dear O
Dr. O
Patton: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O
Michael O
Ogrady O
in O
consultation O
for O
his O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
before O
his O
surgery O
for O
esophageal O
cancer. O
As O
you O
know, O
this O
is O
a O
63-year-old O
male O
with O
a O
long O
past O
medical O
history O
which O
includes O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
peripheral O
vascular O
disease, O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
smoking B-SMOKER
history, I-SMOKER
hypercholesterolemia, B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
DVT O
and O
newly O
diagnosed O
esophageal O
carcinoma. O
He O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
his O
cardiologist, O
Yehuda B-PHI
Landers, I-PHI
for O
the O
last O
nine O
years. O
Essentially O
he O
has O
every O
cardiac O
risk O
factor O
and O
known O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
which O
is O
documented O
on O
cardiac O
catheterization O
performed O
on O
1/20/93. B-PHI
The O
catheterization O
demonstrated O
right O
dominant O
system O
with O
100% O
RCA O
lesion, O
a O
complex O
30% O
diagonal O
1 O
lesion O
and O
a O
30% O
marginal O
1 O
lesion. O
There O
was O
collateral O
flow O
noted O
from O
the O
LAD O
to O
the O
right O
PDA O
and O
from O
the O
septal O
2 O
branch O
to O
the O
RCA, O
and O
from O
the O
circumflex O
artery O
to O
the O
RCA. O
The O
procedure O
was O
performed O
through O
the O
right O
radial O
artery O
without O
complications. O
Patient O
also O
has O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
is O
status O
post O
a O
left O
femoral O
posterior O
tibial O
saphenous O
vein O

graft O
in O
2088. B-PHI
He O
is O
also O
status O
post O
atherectomy O
and O
dilatation O
of O
stenosis O
in O
the O
femoral O
to O
posterior O
tibial O
graft. O
He O
also O
had O
a O
left O
leg O
DVT O
in O
2090. B-PHI
His O
activity O
level O
is O
limited O
by O
his O
claudication. O
He O
has O
a O
history O
of O
hypertension O
and O
hypercholesterolemia O
and O
diabetes O
on O
treatment. O
At O
baseline O
he O
has O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
after O
walking O
half O
a O
mile. O
He O
gets O
chest O
pressure O
one O
to O
two O
times O
a O
month. O
However, O
his O
activity O
is O
extremely O
limited. O
He O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
had O
a O
positive O
stress O
test. O
Further O
information O
is O
not O
available. O
Patient O
understands O
he O
has O
coronary O
disease, O
however O
does O
not O
have O
amenable O
disease O
for O
angioplasty. O
On O
catheterization O
he O
had O
preserved O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
62%. O
He O
is O
to O
undergo O
esophageal O
cancer O
surgery O
in O
the O
next O
one O
to O
two O
months O
after O
receiving O
chemotherapy O
and O
radiation O
therapy O
preop. O
Patient O
states O
he O

He O
is O
clearly O
at O

However, O
given O
his O
life-threatening O
esophageal O

patient O
wants O
to O
proceed O
with O

even O
understanding O
possible O

Plan: O
1. O
Dobutamine O

during O

he O
is O
taking O
them O
exactly O
as O
it O

for O
his O
cardiac O

and O
by O
a O
diabetologist O
at O
the O
Claiborne B-PHI
for O
managing O
his O
diabetes. O
He O
had O
no O
other O
complaints. O
His O
bowel O
movements O
are O
regular. O
He O
still O
has O
nocturia O
x3 O
and O
was O
recently O
seen O
by O
a O
urologist O
who O
felt O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
any O
intervention. O
He O
otherwise O
was O
in O
good O
spirits O
and O
has O
no O
immediate O
complaints. O
His O
social O
situation, O
his O
allergies O
and O
and O
his O
family O
history O
and O
past O
medical O
history, O
are O
overall O
as O
previously O
recorded. O
There O
are O
no O
other O
pertinent O
findings O
in O
the O
review O
of O
systems. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
His B-HYPERTENSION
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
140/60. I-HYPERTENSION
He O
looks O
well. O
I O
did O
not O
measure O
his O
weight. O
His O
heart O
rate O
was O
around O
64-68. O
His O
pupils O
are O
equal O
and O
reactive O
to O
light O
and O
extraocular O
movements O
were O
full. O
Mucous O
membranes O
of O
the O
mouth O
and O
tongue O
were O
normal. O
Lungs O
were O
clear O
to O
percussion O
and O
auscultation. O
Cardiac O
exam O
showed O
regular O
sinus O
rhythm, O
a O
normal O
S2 O
and O
no O
significant O

Liver O
and O
spleen O
were O
not O
palpable. O
He O
had O
only O
1+ O
peripheral O
edema O
which O
is O
less O
than O
usual. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
He O
seems O
stable, O
I O
think O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
regulation O
of O

I O
have O
asked O
him O

follow O
through. O
All O
studies O
were O
negative O
except O
for O
the O
gastric O
emptying O
study. O
She O
has O
been O
treated O
with O
multiple O
medications, O
including O
Reglan, O
Ativan, O
Compazine, O
and O
Zelnorm O
without O
much O
effect. O
She O
is O
currently O
taking O
Neurontin O
and O
Cymbalta O
to O
treat O
neuropathic O
pain, O
and O
her O
PCP O
started O
her O
on O
MS O
Contin O
in O
December B-PHI
since O
nothing O
else O
seemed O
to O
be O
helping. O
The O
pt O
states O
that O
the O
MS O
Contin O
helped O
during O
the O
month O
of O
December, O
but O
then O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
working O
as O
well. O
The O
pt O
is O
distraught O
over O
her O
symptoms O
because O
the O
pain O
is O
severe O
and O
frequent. O
She O
has O
been O
unable O
to O
return O
to O
work O
for O
2 O
years O
because O
of O
the O
pain, O
and O
she O
would O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so. O
The O
pain O
is O
not O
necessarily O
related O
to O
eating. O
Yesterday, O
she O
felt O
well O
and O
was O
able O
to O
eat. O
Today, O
she O
was O
doing O
fine O
until O
she O
had O
to O
drink O
the O
gastrografin, O
and O
then O
it O
escalated O
to O
an O
8/10. O
She O
received O
some O
IV O
morphine, O
and O
now O
it O
is O
down O
to O
4/10. O
At O
Missouri O
Baptist O
Hospital, O
her O
MS O
Contin O
was O
held, O
but O
when O
her O
BP O
went O
up, O
she O
was O
restarted O
on O
it. O
They O
also O
started O
clonidine O
BID O
for O
her O
uncontrolled O
HTN. O
It O
appears O
that O
a O
AFP O
level O
was O
drawn O
and O
was O
elevated O
at O
11.1. O
However, O
it O
is O
written O
multiple O

in O

that O
she O
had O
an O

IMPRESSION: O
The O
patient O
has O
numerous O
risk O
factors O
for O
stroke O
with O
HTN, O
DM2, B-DIABETES
and O
HLP. O
His O
exam O
is O
consistent O
with O
lateral O
medullary O
pyramid O
lesion O
with O
involvement O
of O
spinalcortical O
tract O
prior O
to O
decussation O
explaining O
ipsilateral O
weakness O
and O
also O
involvement O
of O
the O
spinalthalamic O
tract O
explaining O
contralateral O
deficit O
in O
pain O
sensation. O
His O
vessel O
imaging O
is O
notable O
and O
concerning O
for O
diffuse O
atherosclerotic O
disease, O
specifically O
in O
posterior O
circulation O
in O
distribution O
of O
acute O
stroke. O
The O
patient O
was O
reportedly O
taking O
aspirin, O
though O
reports O
are O
mixed O
and O
this O
needs O
clarification. O
Vessel O
imaging O
did O
not O
implicate O
that O
the O
patient O
suffered O
from O
acute O
vertebro-basilar O
thrombo-embolism, O
but O
that O
his O
posterior O
circulation O
disease O
is O
a O
chronic O
issue O
and O
the O
stroke O
was O
more O
likely O
due O
to O
distal O
vessel O
thrombosis. O
Anticoagulation O
can O
be O
considered O
in O
acute O
setting O
of O
small O
sized O
posterior O
circulation O
stroke O
with O
vertebro-basilar O
disease, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
by O
the O
time O
the O
patient O
became O
known O
to O
neurology O
service O
and O
by O
the O
time O
it O
was O
known O
he O
had O
a O
stroke O
it O
was O
some O
24hrs O
after O
initial O
symptoms, O
and O
in O
this O
interval O
he O
did O
not O
show O
any O
signs O
or O
symptoms O
of O
stroke O
progression O
making O
unstable O
plaque O
unlikely. O
Given O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
WASID O
study O
that O
anticoagulation O
did O
not O
significantly O
improve O
recurrent O
stroke O
prevention O
benefits O
over O
aspirin O
for O
symptomatic O
vertebro-basilar O
disease O
(because O
warfarin O
benefits O
were O
offset O
by O
higher O
hemorrhage O
rates), O
the O
decision O
to O
place O
this O
patient O
on O
aspirin O
is O
supported. O
The O
long O
term O
management O
of O
this O
patient O
requires O
aggressive O
control O
of O
atherosclerotic O
risk O
factors O
such O
as O
HTN, O
DM2, O
and O
HLP. O
The O
patient O
is O
significantly O
at O
risk O
of O
major O
ischemic O
stroke O
due O
to O
occluded O
right O
carotid O
artery O
and O
diffuse O
posterior O
circulation O
disease, O
and O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
if O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
persistent O
symptoms O
in O
the O
future O
that O
a O
revascularization O
procedure O
may O
be O
necessary. O

on O

Betty O
Gillis O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
73-year-old B-PHI
woman O
who O
was O
recently O
admitted O
to O
the O
Griffin B-PHI
Memorial I-PHI
Hospital I-PHI
in O
early O
February B-PHI
2085 I-PHI
with O
a O
right O
MCA O
territory O
stroke O
characterized O
clinically O
by O
drooling O
and O
left O
hand O
weakness. O
Fortunately, O
her O
symptoms O
have O
now O
resolved O
and O
she O
is O
back O
to O
her O
regular O
activities. O
We O
understand O
that O
she O
has O
also O
had O
previous O
strokes. O
In O
December B-PHI
2082, I-PHI
she O
was O
suffering O
a O
dizzy O
spell O
and O
subsequently O
an O
MRI O
of O
her O
brain O
found O
a O
posterior O
circulation O
cerebellar O
infarct O
as O
well O
as O
a O
couple O
of O
basal O
ganglia O
lacunar O
infarct. O
She O
recalls O
having O
only O
V2 O
clinical O
events. O
She O
was O
worked O
up O
in O
the O
Griffin O
Memorial O
Hospital O
and O
had O
a O
Holter, O
which O
demonstrated O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
minor O
ectopy O
only, O
an O
echocardiogram, O
which O
was O
reported O
as O
essentially O
normal O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
positive O
saline O
contrast O
bubble O
study O
suggesting O
a O
patent O
foramen O
ovale, O
an O
MRI O
of O
her O
head O
which O
demonstrated O
the O
infarct O
and O
marked O
microvascular O
disease, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
CT O
angiogram O
of O
her O
head O
and O
neck O
arteries, O
which O
demonstrated O
mild O
atheroma O
for O
the O
most O
part O
with O
a O
left O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
stenosis O
that O
was O
less O
than O
50%. O
She O
is O
referred O
to O
us O
today O
for O
an O
opinion O
as O
to O
how O
to O
manage O
the O
possible O
patent O
foramen O
ovale. O
This O
lady O
has O
never O
had O
cardiac O
problems O
otherwise. O
There O
is O
no O
history O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation, O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
or O
congestive O
heart O
failure. O
She O
does O
not O
get O
exertional O
chest O
discomfort O
(chest O
pain O
or O
shortness O
of O

and O
has O
no O
history O
of O
syncope O
or O

She O
has O
no O
history O
of O
PND, O
orthopnea O
or O
edema. O
She O
remains O
fairly O
active O
despite O
her O
ataxic O
gait. O
She O
tells O
me O
that O
she O
is O
able O
to O
walk O
several O
blocks O
without O
difficulty O
and O
never O
has O
any O
exertional O
chest O

Moreover, O
she O

Social O
History: O

She O
is O
a O
retired O
Secretary. B-PHI
She O
is O
an O
ex-smoker O
(more O
than O

but O
does O
not O
drink O
significant O

alcohol. O
She O
has O
no O
other O
history O
of O

Review O
of O
Systems: O
Functional O
inquiry O
is O
positive O
for O
difficulties O
with O
psoriasis O
that O
are O
chronic O
and O
ongoing. O
She O
has O
no O
other O
new O
symptoms. O
There O
is O
no O
recent O
GI O
bleeding. O
She O
has O
difficulties O
with O
bladder O
incontinence O
as O
well. O
On O
physical O
examination O
today, O
her O
heart O
rate O
is O
86 O
beats O
per O
minute O
and O
regular O
and O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
122/78 O
in O
the O
right O
arm O
and O
124/80 O
in O
the O
left O
arm. O
Respiratory O
rate O
is O
20 O
and O
she O
is O
pink O
on O
room O
air. O
Head O
and O
neck O
exam O
is O
unremarkable. O
There O
are O
no O
carotid O
bruits. O
She O
has O
some O
kyphoscoliosis O
of O
her O
spine. O
Her O
chest O
examination O
reveals O
no O
dullness O
to O
percussion O
and O
vesicular O
breath O
sounds O
only. O
Her O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
is O
not O
elevated. O
Central O
pulses O
are O
normal O
in O
volume O
and O
contour. O
Her O
apex O
beat O
is O
within O
normal O
limits. O
Heart O
sounds O
include O
a O
normal O
S1 O
and O
S2 O
with O
no O
murmurs. O
Her O
abdomen O
is O
soft O
and O
nontender. O
There O
are O
no O
obvious O
masses. O
Her O
aorta O
does O
not O
obviously O
appear O
to O
be O
enlarged. O
Her O
pulses O
are O
palpable O
in O
her O
groin, O
but O
hard O
to O
feel O
behind O
her O
knees O
and O
distally. O
They O
are O
symmetrical. O
Informally, O
ABI O
test O
was O
not O
done O
today O
because O
she O
has O
several O
weeping O
eczematous O
lesions O
on O
her O
legs, O
which O
reflects O
psoriasis O
that O
has O
been O
excoriated. O
A O
brief O
neurologic O
exam O
reveals O
dysmetria O
worse O
on O
the O
left O
than O
the O
right. O
Impression: O
Betty O
Gillis O
has O
had O
at O
least O
four O
strokes O
and O
has O
documented O
evidence O
of O
atherosclerotic O
vascular O
disease O
and O
cerebromicrovascular O
disease O
on O
recent O
imaging. O
We O
reviewed O
the O
echocardiogram O
today O
and O
we O
wished O
to O
confirm O
with O
the O
reading O
echocardiographer O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
positive. O
(It O
does O
not O
look O
particularly O
positive O
to O
our O
eyes). O
Certainly, O
if O
she O
does O
not O
indeed O
have O
a O
patent O
foramen O
ovale, O
there O
is O
no O
issue O
as O
to O
what O
to O
do O
about O
it. O
If O
she O
does O
have O
one; O
however, O
it O
seems O
more O
likely O
that O
her O
strokes O
reflect O
her O
atherosclerotic O
vascular O
disease O
secondary O
to O
her O
atherosclerotic O
risk O
factors O
and O
that O
the O
bulk O
of O
treatment O
should O
be O
directed O
at O
modulating O
those. O
Her O
hypertension O
is O
controlled O
today. O
Her O
dyslipidemia O
is O
not O
bad. O
However, O
the O
LDL O
is O
76 O
and O
perhaps O
there O
is O
some O
added O
benefit O
to O
increasing O
her O
simvastatin O
to O
80 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily. O
We O
also O
note O
that O
she O
has O
had O
elevated O
glucoses O
in O
the O
past, O
as O
high O
as O
191, O
as O
well O
as O
an O
elevated B-DIABETES
hemoglobin I-DIABETES
A1c I-DIABETES
up I-DIABETES
to I-DIABETES
6.5. I-DIABETES
It O
is O
probably O
worth O
having O
her O
screen O
formally O
to O
see O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
has O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus O
versus O
insulin O
insensitivity O
only. O
She O
may O
benefit O
from O
an O
oral O
hypoglycemic. O
We O
recommend. O
1. O
We O
will O
review O
the O
echocardiogram O
with O
the O
reading O
echocardiographer O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
does O
indeed O
show O
a O
patent O
foramen O
ovale. O
2. O
We O
suggest O
that O
she O
increase O
her O
statin O
from O
simvastatin O
40 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily O
to O
simvastatin O
80 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily. O
We O
will O
leave O
this O
to O
her O
primary O
care O
physician O
to O
organize. O
3. O
We O
suggest O
that O
she O
be O
screened O
formally O
for O
diabetes O
mellitus O
type O
2. O
We O
will O
see O
her O
again O
as O
necessary, O
but O
for O
the O
time O
being, O
we O
have O
no O
plans O
to O
perform O
an O
intervention O
on O
this O
lady. O

(axillary O

mass) O
History: O
Patient O
is O
a O
72 B-PHI
year O
old O
man O
who O
began O
having O
dysphagia O
about O
4 O
weeks O
ago. O
On O
8/01/83 B-PHI
he O
was O
scheduled O
for O
a O
Colonoscopy, O
so O
his O
PCP O
suggested O
he O
have O
an O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
The O
Colonoscopy O
demonstrated O
Diverticulosis O
and O
the O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
demonstrated O
a O
partially O
obstructing O
esophageal/gastric O
cardia O
tumor O
which O
was O
biopsied. O
Pathology O
revealed O
moderately O
to O
poorly O
differentiated O
adenocarcinoma. O
On O
8/10/83 B-PHI
an O
Abd O
and O
Pelvic O
CT O
were O
done O
showing: O
marked O
thickening O
of O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
distal O
esophagus O
(35-40cm O
by O
endoscopy O
- O
partial O
obstruction O
and O
circumferential) O
extending O
into O
the O
gastric O
cardia, O
consistent O
with O
biopsy O
proven O
adenocarcinoma. O
Also O
felt O
to O
be O
bleeding O
silently O
so O
placed O
on O
Fe O
replacement. O
Also, O
enlarged O
gastroepiploic, O
celiac O
and O
aortocaval O
lymph O
nodes O
consistent O
with O
metastatic O
disease. O
On O
8/10/83 O
a O
Chest O
CT O
revealed O
thickening O
of O
the O
lower O
esophagus O
extending O
into O
the O
chest O
esophageal O
junction. O
This O
is O
associated O
with O
lymphadenopathy O
in O
the O
(L) O
axilla, O
gastrohepatic O
ligament, O
celiac O
axis O
and O
retrocrural O
space. O
The O
appearance O
is O
highly O
suspicious O
for O
esophageal O
cancer O
and O

spread. O
There O
is O
a O
3mm O

in O

PET O

with O

The O
lung O
nodule O
was O
too O

for O

He O
remains O
quite O

He O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
Given O
the O
fairly O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
his O
cancer O
we O
have O
opted O
to O
start O
with O
radiation O

as O
his O
primary O
mass O

in O
nature O
and O
there O
has O
been O

of O

After O
radiation O
is O
completed O
in O
3-4 O
weeks, O
I O
will O
see O
him O
for O
consideration O
of O
chemotherapy O
but O
only O
after O
re-staging. O
If O
he O
remains O
asymptomatic O
and O
there O
has O
been O
little O
progression O
of O
disease, O
we O
may O
opt O
to O
observe O
him O
closely O
without O
treatment. O
If O
the O
scans O
show O
significant O
progression O
or O
he O
becomes O
symptomatic, O
then O
we O
will O
start O
systemic O
treatment O
soon O
afterwards. O
He O
is O

candidate O
given O
his O
stage O

and O
lack O

RTC O
in O

Dear O
Dr. O
Hodges: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Peter O
Joshi O
in O
the O
Cardiovascular B-PHI
Clinic I-PHI
at O
the O
Hospital B-PHI
Regional I-PHI
Universitario. I-PHI
This O
lovely O
gentleman O
with O
ischemic O
heart O
disease O
and O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
has O
been O
followed O
in O
our O
clinic O
since O
the O
time O
of O
his O
carotid O
endarterectomy O
and O
cardiac O
procedure. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
he O
notes O
that O
he O
has O
been O
very O
minimally O
active O
because O
of O
the O
flooding. B-PHI
He O
has O
had O
no O
paroxysms O
of O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
exertional O
neck, O
chest, O
arm O
or O
jaw O
pain. O
He O
has O
had O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
at O
greater O
than O
4 O
METS O
of O
activity O
and O
he O
does O
have O
mild O
lower O
extremity O
edema. O
His O
medical O
regimen O
includes O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
Demadex, O
isosorbide, B-MEDICATION
Lopressor, B-MEDICATION
simvastatin, B-MEDICATION
Norvasc, B-MEDICATION
Prevacid, O
multivitamins, O
potassium O
chloride O
and O
insulin. B-MEDICATION
On O
physical O
examination, O
his O
weight O
is O
223 O
pounds. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
is O
124/60 O
right O
and O
left O
arm O
seated. O
His O
heart O
rate O
is O
54 O
and O
regular. O
Respiratory O
rate O
is O
10. O
There O
is O
a O
mild O
increase O
in O
jugular O
venous O
pressure. O
Carotids O
are O
without O
bruits. O
Lungs O
are O
actually O
clear O
to O
auscultation O
throughout. O
Cardiovascular O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
but O
no O
gallop O
is O
present. O
His O
abdomen O
is O
soft, O
nontender, O
free O
of O
organomegaly O
and O
bruits. O
Extremities O
are O
notable O
for O
symmetric O
pulses O
somewhat O
diminished O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
posterior O
tibialis O
and O
mild O
pitting O
edema O
to O
the O
midshin O
bilaterally. O
His O
electrocardiogram O
is O
sinus O
bradycardia O
with O
inverted O
T O
waves O
in O
I O
and O
L. O
No O
significant O
change O
from O
prior O
electrocardiograms. O
In O
summary, O
Patrick B-PHI
Joshi I-PHI
looks O
like O
he O
is O
in O
mild O
volume O
overload O
at O
the O
present O
time. O
He O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
had O
renal O
insufficiency O
in O
the O
past. O
Before O
adjusting O
his O
Demadex O
dosing, O
I O
will O
reassess O
his O
kidney O
profile. O

CHIEF O
COMPLAINT: O
Ms. O
Greenwood B-PHI
comes O
in O
to O
urgent O
care O
clinic O
for O
hives O
after O
taking O
Keflex. O
HISTORY B-SMOKER
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
She O
is O
a O
47-year-old B-PHI
woman O
with O
chronic O
hydradenitis O
suppurativa O
since O
the O
age O
of O
18 B-PHI
in O
her O
left O
axilla O
and O
her O
groin. O
She O
has O
been O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
multiple O
times O
for O
purulent O
drainage O
around O
her O
groin. O
She O
has O
been O
given O
multiple O
courses O
of O
antibiotics O
including O
Keflex O
and O
dicloxacillin. O
She O
is O
planning O
to O
have O
her O
disease O
surgically O
managed O
in O
the O
next O
few O
months. O
She O
most O
recently O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
on O
January B-PHI
7, I-PHI
2079 I-PHI
with O
swelling O
and O
drainage O
of O
her O
hydradenitis O
in O
her O
groin. O
She O
was O
given O
a O
prescription O
of O
Keflex. O
Shortly O
after O
taking O
the O
first O
tablet, O
she O
developed O
itching O
in O
the O
hands, O
face, O
and O
legs O
and O
as O
well O
as O
hives. O
She O
denied O
any O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
difficulty O
breathing O
or O
loss O
of O
consciousness. O
She O
called O
the O
emergency O
room O
and O
was O
instructed O
to O
stop O
taking O
Keflex O
as O
this O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
allergic O
reaction. O
So O
now, O
she O
is O
here O
for O
follow O
up O
from O
that. O
She O
said O
shortly O
after O
stopping O
antibiotic O
her O
symptoms O
of O
hives O
and O
itchiness O
have O
improved O
very O
quickly. O
She O
is O
still O
complaining O
of O
purulent O
drainage O
around O
her O
groin. O
PAST O
MEDICAL O
HISTORY: O
Diabetes. B-DIABETES
MEDICATIONS: O
Glucotrol, B-MEDICATION
Percocet O
as O
needed O
for O
pain. O
ALLERGIES: O
She O
is O
allergic O
to O
erythromycin O
and O
now O
Keflex. O
She O
gets O
hives O
from O
both. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
Her O
left O
axilla O
looks O
dry. O
Her O
bilateral O
groins O
looks O
red, O
swollen O
tender O
with O
some O
serous O
as O
well O
as O
some O
purulent O
drainage. O
There O
is O
no O
fluctuance O
that O
I O
could O
feel. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
Worsening O
of O
her O
hydradenitis. O
Given O
the O
recent O
allergy O
to O
Keflex, O
we O
will O
obviously O
need O
to O
take O
a O
different O
antibiotic. O
She O
has O
been O
on O
dicloxacillin O
in O
the O
past O
with O
good O
result. O
Despite O
the O
15% O
cross O
allergy O
of O
dicloxacillin O
compared O
to O
Keflex, O
I O
think O
dicloxacillin O
is O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
now. O
If O
this O
does O
not O
work, O
I O
think O
one O
should O
consider O
clindamycin O
for O
treatment. O
I O
will O
go O
ahead O
and O
give O
her O
14 O
days O
worth O
of O
dicloxacillin O
and O
I O
instructing O
her O
to O
notify O
M.D. O
if O
she O
develops O
any O
allergic O
reaction O
to O
this O
medicine. O
I O
also O
gave O
her O
60 O
tablets O
of O
Percocet O
as O
well O
as O
renewed O
her O
renewed O
her O
prescription O
of O
Glucotrol B-MEDICATION
XL I-MEDICATION
2.5 O
mg O
a O
day. O
She O
should O
see O
her O
PCP O
in O
two O
weeks. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Pagan: O
Your O
patient O
Lauren B-PHI
Ferrara B-PHI
came O
into O
the O
office O
today O
for O
a O
follow-up O
visit. O
As O
you O
know, O
she O
has O
a O
long O
and O
complex O
history O
of O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
with O
bilateral O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafts. O
Her O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
had O
occluded O
once O
previously, O
but O
was O
successfully O
restored O
by O
Dr. O
Tejeda. B-PHI
In O
02/61, B-PHI
we O
had O
detected O
a O
high-grade O
stenosis O
in O
the O
distal O
aspect O
of O
this O
graft O
by O
surveillance, O
and O
she O
underwent O
revision O
with O
a O
local O
patch O
angioplasty. O
A O
subsequent O
ultrasound O
study O
done O
in O
04/61 B-PHI
showed O
a O
widely O
patent O
graft O
and O
she O
has O
remained O
entirely O
asymptomatic. O
She O
is O
not O
particularly O
active. O
She O
denies O
any O
rest O
pain O
in O
the O
feet O
or O
significant O
claudication O
symptoms. O
Recently, O
however, O
her O
husband O
had O
noticed O
some O
cyanosis O
of O
her O
left O
toes. O
She O
remains O
on O
low O
dose O
aspirin B-MEDICATION
in O
addition O
to O
Lipitor B-MEDICATION
and O
her O
other O
medications. O
She O
is O
a O
nonsmoker. B-SMOKER
On O
examination O
today, O
she O
appeared O
well O
and O
in O
good O
spirits. O
Blood O
pressure O
was O
measured O
at O
130/60 O
in O
the O
right O
arm. O
Lower O
extremity O
pulses O
are O
2+ O
at O
the O
femoral O
level O
bilaterally. O
On O
the O
right, O
there O
is O
a O
strong, O
easily O
appreciated O
pulse O
over O
her O
popliteal O
to O
dorsalis O
pedis O
bypass O
graft, O
and O
the O
foot O
is O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused. O
On O
the O
left, O
I O
could O
not O
appreciate O
a O
pulse O
over O
her O
bypass O
graft O
incisions. O
The O
left O
foot O
is O
slightly O
cooler O
than O
the O
right, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
mild O
cyanotic O
changes O
on O
the O
first O
toe O
in O
particular. O
There O
are O
no O
frank O
or O
impending O
ulcerations O
or O
areas O
of O
irreversible O
ischemia. O
There O
is O
a O
strong O
Doppler O
signal O
obtained O
over O
the O
posterior O
tibial O
artery O
at O
the O
ankle O
with O
an O
occlusion O
pressure O
of O
approximately O
100 O
mmHg. O
This O
yields O
an O
ankle O
index O
of O
nearly O
0.7 O
and O
maybe O
falsely O
elevated. O
A O
follow-up O
ultrasound O
study O
was O
performed O
in O
the O
vascular O
laboratory O
today. O
The O
right O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
remains O
widely O
patent. O
As O
suspected, O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
has O
now O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
occluded. O
Ms. O
Ferrara O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
has O
occluded O
sometime O
during O
the O
last O
several O
months O
and O
her O
collateralization O
is O
clearly O
more O
marginal. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
she O
does O
not O
have O
any O
clear-cut O
symptoms O
of O
critical O
limb O
ischemia, O
though O
the O
slight O
discoloration O
of O
her O
toes O
is O
a O
clear O
sign. O
The O
previous O
history O
of O
this O
graft O
including O
a O
prior O
thrombosis O
requiring O
thrombectomy O
and O
multiple O
revisions O
would O
not O
board O
well O
for O
any O
attempted O
thrombolysis O
or O
repeated O
rescue O
of O
this O
particular O
conduit. O
Conversely, O
she O
has O
already O
had O
all O
of O
her O
lower O
extremity O
veins O
used O
for O
bypass O
operations O
and O
any O
redo O
bypass O
would O
be O
technically O
complicated. O
I O
will O
need O
to O
review O
her O
previous O
angiograms O
from O
earlier O
this O
year O
to O
determine O
the O
status O
of O
her O
runoff O
and O
what O
the O
alternatives O
might O
be. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
however, O
she O
appears O
to O
have O
marginal, O
though O
reasonable O
collateralization O
and O
is O
essentially O
asymptomatic. O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
increase O
her O
antithrombotic O
therapy O
and O
I O
added O
a O
daily O
dose O
of O
Plavix O
to O
supplement O
a O
baby B-MEDICATION
aspirin. I-MEDICATION
I O
spent O
sometime O
discussing O
the O
signs O
of O
worsening O
ischemia O
including O
more O
diffuse O
cyanotic O
skin O
changes O
of O
the O
toes, O
rest O
pain, O
or O
ulceration. O
At O
a O
minimum, O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
two O
months O
for O
reexamination, O
but O
I O
strongly O
encouraged O
the O
patient O
and O
her O
husband O
to O
contact O
us O
soon O
if O
there O
are O
any O
symptoms O
that O
suggest O
worsening O
of O
her O
circulation. O
If O
her O
collateralization O
can O
remain O
stable, O
it O
certainly O
would O
be O
preferable O
to O
avoid O
having O
to O
consider O
a O
complex O
redo O
bypass O
with O
very O
limited O
remaining O
vein O
in O
this O
patient. O
Thank O
you O
again O
for O
allowing O
us O
to O
participate O
in O
her O
care. O
Please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O
if O
I O
can O
be O
of O
further O
assistance. O
Sincerely, O

Rapidly O

Abdominal O

be O
multifactorial. O
I O
don't O
doubt O
that O
this O
is O
most O
likely O
hyperglycemia O
with O
associated O
gut O
dysmotility, O
but O
differential O
includes O
small O
bowel O
angina O
(pain O
is O
definitely O
out O

hepatobiliary O
disease. O
With O
normal O

I O
doubt O
that O
this O
is O
ischemic O

of O

but O
small O

angina O
is O
still O
a O
possibility. O
Recommendations: O
1) O
Gastroparesis O
may O
be O
in O
part O
due O
to O
poor O

we O
need O

3) O
For O

you O

Colonoscopy O

were O
normal O
earlier O

this O
does O
not O
exclude O

would O
be O
MR O

I O
do O
not O
think O
this O
is O
warranted O
at O

but O
ischemic O
small O

should O
remain O
on O
the O
differential. O
4) O
With O
hyperdynamic O
precordium O
and O
tachycardia, O
would O
check O
TSH, O
though O
this O
is O
almost O
certainly O
due O
to O

Dear O

of O
exertional O
fatigue, O

Impression: O
Mrs. O
Joshy B-PHI
continues O
to O
suffer O
from O
morbid B-OBESE
obesity, I-OBESE
and O
I O
had O
a O
long O
discussion O
with O
her O
and O
her O
daughter O
regarding O
the O
essential O
nature O
of O
her O
engaging O
in O
an O
aggressive O
weigh O
reduction O
program. O
I O
once O
again O
have O
strongly O
encouraged O
her O
to O
make O
an O
appointment O
with O
our O
obesity O
clinic O
to O
assist O
in O
extensive O
weight O
reduction. O
I O
also O
discussed O
with O
her O
my O
concerns O
regarding O
her O
symptoms O
of O
slowly O
progressive O
peripheral O
edema, O
particularly O
as O
it O
pertains O
both O
to O
her O
weight, O
and O
atrial O
or O
tachyarrhythmias. O
As O
in O
the O
past, O
she O
told O
me O
that O
she O
would O
refuse O
any O
consideration O
for O
attempted O
cardioversion O
or O
other O
studies. O
She O
did, O
however, O
agree O
to O
continue O
with O
her O
current O
medical O
regimen. O
I O
obtained O
routine O
blood O
studies O
today O
to O
verify O
the O
adequacy O
of O
her O
lipid O
control O
and O
diabetes O
management. O
I O
have O
introduced O
her O
to O
Hayden B-PHI
Nutter, I-PHI
her O
nurse O
practitioner, O
who O
will O
assist O
in O
trying O
to O
achieve O
a O
little O
more O
diuresis O
overt O
he O
next O
few O
weeks. O
We O
have O
given O
her O
a O
prescription O
for O
Zaroxylyn O
to O
begin O
at O
2.5 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d., O
which O
will O
help O
result O
in O
some O
degree O
of O
mild O
diuresis. O
Nonetheless, O
she O
understands O
that O
significant O
weight O
loss O
can O
only O
occur O
through O
a O
weight O
reduction O
program. O
I O
have O
of O
course O
explained O
to O
her O
the O
increased O
cardiac O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
her O
current O
lifestyle. O
Beyond O
this, O
I O
have O
not O
altered O
her O
current O
medical O
regimen. O
Of O
course, O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O
his O
care. O
Sincerely O
yours, O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
A O
65-year-old B-PHI
female O
who O
presents O
today O
for O
hospital O
followup. O
I O
admitted O
her O
to O
the O
HH B-PHI
on O
10/03/79 B-PHI
with O
an O
episode O
of O
hypoxemia, O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
secondary O
to O
CHF O
and O
diastolic O
dysfunction. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
johnson B-PHI
rest I-PHI
home I-PHI
on O
10/12/79. B-PHI
Two O
hours O
after O
arrival, O
she O
had O
a O
respiratory O
arrest O
and O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
at O
Clinica B-PHI
Rovira I-PHI
where O
she O
stayed O
until O
11/03/79. B-PHI
She O
is O
extremely O
difficult O
to O
diurese O
because O
of O
her O
tenuous O
renal O
function, O
this O
required O
multiple O
adjustments O
of O
her O
medication. O
Stress O
test O
showed O
no O
ischemia O
and O
echocardiogram O
showed O
concentric O
left O
ventricular O
hypertrophy O
with O
normal O
chamber O
size O
and O
systolic O
function, O
estimated O
ejection O
fraction O
is O
65% O
as O
well O
as O
biatrial O
enlargement O
. O
She O
did O
well O
acutely O
with O
BiPAP O
and O
remains O
on O
oxygen. O
As O
part O
of O
her O
workup, O
she O
had O
pulmonary O
function O
tests, O
which O
showed O
moderate O
obstruction O
without O
a O
bronchodilator O
response O
and O
some O
mild O
restriction O
likely O
due O
to O
her O
obesity. B-OBESE
In O
addition, O
she O
was O
quite O
anemic O
with O
hematocrit O
of O
19 O
on O
presentation. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
hemolysis. O
She O
is O
mildly O
iron O
deficient O
and O
colonoscopy O
showed O
a O
tubulovillous O
adenoma, O
which O
was O
excised O
as O
well O
as O
a O
short O
area O
of O
Barrett's O
esophagus. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
active O
bleeding. O
She O
received O
multiple O
transfusions O
throughout O
her O
stay O
and O
was O
started O
on O
darbepoetin, O
for O
what O
was O
ultimately O
felt O
to O
be O
anemia O
of O
renal O
disease. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
Lahey B-PHI
Clinic I-PHI
and O
has O
just O
returned O
home. O

She O
will O

I O
will O
speak O
to O
Dr. O
Vandiver, B-PHI
her O
cardiologist O
whom O
she O
is O
seeing O
next O

about O
getting O
her O
enrolled O

4. O
Chronic O
renal O
insufficiency. O
Creatinine O
at O
baseline O
of O

She O
will O
need O
to O
be O
watched O
closely. O
She O
expressed O
interest O
in O
possibility O
of O
her O
renal O
transplant O
should O
that O
become O
necessary. O
There O
has O
been O
a O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
she O
has O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
based O
on O
a O
Doppler O
ultrasound O
done O
during O
rehabilitation. O
I O
think O
this O
must O
have O
been O
done O
at O
Brookwood B-PHI
Hospital I-PHI
because O
no O
studies O
are O
available O
in O
the O
HH O
system. O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
had O
done O
MRA O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago, O
which O
showed O
no O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
at O
that O
time, O
but O
her O
worsening O
renal O
function O
is O
new. O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
next O
week O
and O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
her O
expressly O
raising O
this O
issue. O
Her O
son O
brought O
up O
the O
issue O
of O
perhaps O
consolidating O
all O
her O
care O
at O
the O
HH O
,in O
particular O
is O
seeing O
a O
nephrologist O
here. O
She O
is O
quite O
fond O
of O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
who O
has O
cared O
for O
her O
for O
years, O
but O
I O
think O
given O
the O
complexity O
of O
medical O
care. O
this O
might O
not O
be O
a O
bad O
idea. O
She O
is O
going O
to O
discuss O
with O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
and O
I O
will O
E-mail O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
as O
well. O

She O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
Barrett's O

she O
will O
need O
to O
have O
followup O

1 O

for O
this. O

Heme. O
Her O
anemia O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
iron O
deficiency O
and O
anemia O
of O
renal O

She O
needed O
several O
transfusions O
during O
the O

She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Hematology O
at O
Stone-Wheeling B-PHI
in O

In O
the O

I O
have O
spoken O

Dr. O
Dougherty O
who O
agrees O
to O
monitor O
her O
in O
the O
Renal B-PHI
Department I-PHI
at O

If O
necessary, O
they O
can O

I O
will O

He O
has O
been O
working O

with O
some O

Other O
complaints O
include O

to O
improve O
over O
the O

for O
about O
one O

The O
patient O
is O
in O
no O

Her O
initial O
blood O

as O
she O
walked O
down O
the O

was O
154/71. B-HYPERTENSION

ASSESSMENT: O
Uncontrolled O
adult O
onset O
diabetes. O
Care O
for O
this O
will O
be O
challenging O
due O
to O
the O
patient's O
cognitive O
problems. O
She O
does O
use O
Valley B-PHI
Hospital I-PHI
Web B-PHI
Services. I-PHI
We O
discussed O
to O
start O
frequent O
communication O
via O
Web O
Services O
of O
test O
results O
will O
be O
helpful O
for O
me O
in O
helping O
her O
adjust O
insulin. O
We O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
of O
changing O
from O
NPH O
to O
Lantus B-MEDICATION
insulin, O
but O
elected O
to O
continue O
her O
NPH O
for O
now. O
We O
discussed O
that O
her O
use O
of O
the O
ultra-fast O
acting O
insulin O
does O
not O
quite O
make O
sense. O
She O
is O
taking O
an O
injection O
in O
the O
evening, O
long O
after O
her O
meal. O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
describe O
her O
meals O
and O
she O
has O
carbohydrates O
essentially O
with O
every O
meal. O
I O
think O
initially O
she O
can O
easily O
tolerate O
10 O
units O
of O
Humalog O
with O
each O
meal. O
She O
notes O
that O
she O
prefers O
to O
inject O
the O
insulin O
after O
she O
eats, O
which O
is O
acceptable O
as O
long O
she O
does O
it O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
the O
meal. O
She O
currently O
is O
using O
an O
average O
of O
15 O
units, O
so O
this O
will O
increase O
her O
total O
daily O
insulin O
use O
by O
just O
15 O
units. O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
check O
3 O
fingersticks O
a O
day O
for O
me O
and O
to O
e-mail O
them O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
start. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fasting O
fingerstick. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
before O
her O
evening O
meal, O
which O
is O
her O
largest O
meal O
of O
the O
day. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
2 O
hours O
after O
her O
evening O
meal. O
She O
does O
not O
need O
to O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
right O
before O
bed. O
She O
will O
stop O
using O
Humalog O
right O
before O
bed O
and O
only O
use O
the O
NPH O
at O
that O
time. O
We O
discussed O
the O
importance O
of O
cholesterol O
treatment. O
Her B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
last B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
LDL I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
was I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
over I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
100. I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
I O
would O
like O
to O
revisit O
the O
idea O
of O
using O
a O
statin. O
I O
will O
repeat O
her O
CK O
level O
to O
see O
if O
this O
remains O
elevated. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
on O
recheck O
is O
acceptable. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
the O
office O
in O
2 O
months O
rather O
than O
what O
is O
booked O
now. O
Most O
of O
our O
visit O
today O
took O
place O
together O
with O
her O
husband. O
We O
spent O
a O
total O
of O
25 O

with O
more O
than O
half O
the O

with O
Clinic O
Attending O
Dr. O
Kim B-PHI
Mays B-PHI
who O
concurs O
with O
the O
assessment O
plan O
that O
I O
will O
outline O
below. O
HISTORY O
OF O
THE O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Nathan O
is O
a O
51-year-old, B-PHI
right-handed O
man O
who O
suffered O
a O
large O
right O
MCA O
territory O
stroke O
in O
October B-PHI
2069. I-PHI
This O
occurred O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
right O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
occlusion, O
and O
hemicraniectomy O
was O
required O
for O
management O
of O
malignant O
cerebral O
edema O
after O
the O
stroke. O
He O
subsequently O
developed O
an O
infection O
of O
the O
abdominal O
bone O
flap. O
His O
stroke O
workup O
revealed O
a O
normal O
echocardiogram O
and O
24-hour O
Holter O
monitor. O
A O
hypercoagulability O
panel O
was O
negative. O
Homocysteine O
was O
normal. O
Serum O
lipid O
analysis O
revealed O
mild O
hypertriglyceridemia. O
His O
recovery O
was O
complicated O
by O
brain O
abscess, O
which O
required O
surgical O
drainage O
and O
prolonged O
antibiotic O
therapy. O
Finally O
an O
artificial O
bone O
flap O
was O
replaced O
in O
October B-PHI
2070. I-PHI
He O
then O
developed O
persistent O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
and O
a O
pseudomeningocele. O
A O
VP O
shunt O
was O
placed O
by O
Dr. O
Bennett. B-PHI
Unfortunately, O
even O
after O
shunting O
there O
was O
persistent O
nausea O
and O
vomiting. O
This O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
Fentanyl O
patch O
use. O
The O
Fentanyl O
was O
subsequently O
replaced O
with O
methadone O
for O
chronic O
left-sided O
neuropathic O
pain, O
and O
the O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
abated. O
I O
last O
saw O
Nathan O
on O
April B-PHI
2nd I-PHI
of O
this O
year O
at O
which O
point O
he O
was O
doing O
quite O
well. O
He O
complained O
of O
some O
hot O
flashes O
of O
unclear O
etiology. O
His O
depression O
seemed O
to O
be O
under O
better O
control O
on O
Celexa. O
Today O
he O
reports O
that O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
trouble O
with O
neuropathic O
pain O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
body. O
Fortunately O
he O
has O
managed O
to O
wean O
himself O
off O
of O
methadone O
and O
this O
has O
not O
caused O
the O
pain O
to O
get O
any O
worse. O
He O
is O
using O
a O
substantial O
dose O
of O
Neurontin, O
which O
he O
thinks O
is O
helpful. O
He O
complains O
that O
these O
pains O
involve O
his O
face, O
arm, O
and O
leg O
on O
the O
left O
side O
and O
he O
wonders O
whether O
there O
might O
be O
some O
relationship O
between O
the O
pain O
and O
the O
shunt, O
which O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
head. O
He O
also O
complains O
of O
occasional O
leg O
spasms O
at O
night, O
which O
are O
not O
particularly O
bothersome. O
His O
most O
significant O
complaint O
at O
this O
time O
relates O
to O
the O
hot O
flashes O
that O
he O
mentioned O
at O
our O
last O
visit. O
These O
often O
occur O
several O
times O
daily, O
although O
they O
may O
not O
occur O
for O
several O
days O
at O
a O
time. O
He O
explains O
that O
most O
of O
the O
episodes O
occur O
when O
he O
is O
in O
bed O
at O
night. O
He O
first O
develops O
a O
feeling O
of O
nausea O
followed O
by O
a O
cold O
sensation O
on O
one O
side O
of O
his O
body O
or O
the O
other. O
This O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
a O
feeling O
of O
heat O
from O
the O
top O
of O
his O
head O
down O
to O
his O
toes. O
There O
may O
be O
a O
feeling O
of O
urinary O
urgency. O
He O
then O
experiences O
a O
sensation O
as O
if O
he O
is O
floating O
on O
the O
bed, O
and O
generally O
this O
is O
followed O
by O
nausea. O
The O
entire O
episode O
lasts O
only O
seconds O
but O
the O
nausea O
may O
persist O
for O
as O
long O
as O
an O
hour. O
He O
also O
notes O
on O
some O
mornings O
he O
does O
not O
feel O
like O
getting O
out O
of O
bed. O
He O
continues O
to O
experience O
depressed O
mood, O
and O
he O
longs O
to O
return O
to O
a O
normal O
state O
of O
functioning. O
He O
has O
returned O
to O
volunteering B-PHI
as I-PHI
a I-PHI
Big I-PHI
Brother. I-PHI
He O
is O
unable O
to O
work. O
His O
divorce O
is O
now O
complete O
and O
he O
is O
really O
glad O
about O
this. O
He O
is O
living O
with O
a O
friend O
named O
Tejeda B-PHI
who O
takes O
excellent O
care O
of O
him. O
His O
left O
arm O
remains O
paralyzed. O
He O
has O
minimal O
proximal O
strength O
in O
his O
leg. O
He O
has O
a O
dense O
visual O
field O
deficit O
on O
the O
left O
side. O
He O
has O
one O
new O
complaint O
which O
is O
a O
feeling O
of O
numbness O
and O
tingling O
in O
the O
4th O
and O
5th O
fingers O
on O
the O

On O
exam O
Nathan O
is O
well-appearing. O
His O
hair O
has O
now O
grown O
back. O
On O
mental O
status O
exam O
he O
is O
able O
to O
relate O
a O
cogent O
history. O
He O
has O
a O
number O
of O
questions O
about O
stroke O
rehabilitation O
possibilities O
including O
a O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
program O
that O
he O
learned O
about O
in O
Connecticut. B-PHI
Eye O
contact O
is O
good. O
On O
cranial O
nerve O
exam O
pupils O
are O
round O
and O
reactive O
and O
extraocular O
movements O
are O
intact. O
There O
is O
a O
left O
visual O
field O
deficit. O
The O
face O
is O
asymmetric O
with O
an O
upper O
motor O
neuron O
pattern O
left O
facial O
droop. O
The O
tongue O
protrudes O
in O
the O
midline. O
The O
left O
arm O
is O
completely O
plegic. O
The O
left O
leg O
has O
greater O
than O
anti-gravity O
proximal O
strength. O
There O
is O
left-sided O
sensory O
extinction. O
Reflexes O
are O
brisk O
on O
the O
left O
and O
normal O
on O
the O
right. O
Nathan O
is O
able O
to O
ambulate O
with O
a O
cane O
and O
a O
left O
ankle O
foot O
orthosis. O
We O
spent O
much O
of O
today's O
visit O
discussing O
various O
issues O
that O
concern O
Nathan. O
Regarding O
the O
possibility O
of O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
therapy O
for O
stroke O
rehabilitation. O
I O
explained O
that O
there O
is O
no O
convincing O
evidence O
in O
favor O
of O
this O
approach. O
There O
are O
some O
risks O
to O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
therapy O
such O
as O
lung O
injury O
and O
the O
programs O
are O
extremely O
costly. O
Therefore O
I O
advised O
Nathan O
not O
to O
pursue O
that O
option. O
Regarding O
his O
frequent O
hot O
flashes, O
which O
are O
very O
bothersome, O
the O
etiology O
of O
these O
episodes O
is O
quite O
unclear. O
Dr. O
Mays O
mentioned O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
episodes O
represent O
some O
sort O
of O
diencephalic O
paroxysmal O
discharges. O
I O
think O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
these O
are O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
Celexa; O
I O
believe O
that O
they O
first O
occurred O
shortly O
after O
starting O
Celexa. O
We O
decided O
to O
stop O
the O
Celexa O
for O
a O
2-week O
period O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
any O
improvement O
in O
the O
episodes. O
If O
there O
is, O
I O
would O
consider O
changing O
to O
an O
antidepressant O
that O
works O
by O
a O
different O
mechanism. O
If O
there O
is O
no O
change O
in O
the O
episodes O
we O
can O
go O
ahead O
and O
add O
Celexa O
back. O
I O
neglected O
to O
mention O
above O
that O
there O
is O
sensory O
loss O
to O
temperature O
and O
pinprick O
in O
the O
right O
hand O
involving O
the O
4th O
and O
5th O
digits O
and O
the O
ulnar O
aspect O
of O
the O
hand O
on O
the O
palmar O
surface. O
There O
is O
no O
motor O
dysfunction O
in O
the O
hand. O
There O
is O
no O
Tinel's O
sign O
over O
the O
ulnar O
nerve O
at O
the O
elbow. O
The O
ulnar O
nerve O
in O
the O
ulnar O
groove O
is O
not O
hypermobile. O
The O
symptoms O
and O
physical O
exam O
are O
consistent O
with O
ulnar O
entrapment O
neuropathy, O
which O
I O
suspect O
is O
the O
result O
of O
arm O
flexion O
during O
sleep. O
I O
suggested O
that O
Nathan O
buy O
an O
elbow O
pad O
with O
a O
Velcro O
strap O
that O
will O
help O
facilitate O
keeping O
the O
arm O
straight O
during O
sleep. O
We O
will O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
this O
over O
time. O
No O
other O
changes O
are O
indicated O
at O
the O
moment. O
I O
intend O
to O
see O
Nathan O
in O
followup O
in O
about O
6 O
months. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Kay: O
I O
saw O
Dalila O
Haynes O
today O
in O
consultation O
concerning O
the O
possibility O
of O
neurosarcoidosis. O
She O
comes O
with O
her O
daughter O
who O
assists O
with O
the O
history. O
I O
will O
review O
her O
history O
for O
the O
record. O
She O
is O
a O
69-year-old B-PHI
right-handed O
woman O
who O
was O
hospitalized O
at O
the O
Promptcare B-PHI
in O
July B-PHI
2103 I-PHI
for O
evaluation O
of O
mental O
and O
motor O
slowing, O
memory O
loss, O
and O
weight O
loss. O
Her O
daughter O
notes O
that O
she O
had O
deteriorated O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
month O
or O
two. O
Her O
movements O
slowed O
down, O
and O
she O
became O
unsteady O
on O
her O
feet, O
and O
her O
memory O
deteriorated. O
This O
culminated O
in O
a O
fall O
in O
July O
prompting O
her O
hospitalization. O
During O
that O
hospitalization O
a O
head O
CT O
on O
7/25/03 B-PHI
was O
reported O
unremarkable. O
(There O
is O
mild O
ventriculomegaly O
on O
it.) O
An O
MRI O
of O
the O
brain O
on O
7/28 B-PHI
showed O
a O
few O
dots O
of O
restricted O
diffusion O
in O
the O
left O
thalamus. O
There O
was O
no O
abnormal O
enhancement. O
This O
was O
consistent O
with O
small O
vessel O
stroke. O
EEG O
showed O
generalized O
slowing O
of O
the O
background O
in O
the O
theta O
and O
delta O
range O
with O
no O
epileptiform O
features. O
An O
LP O
showed O
normal O
glucose O
(74), O
elevated O
protein O
(102), O
lymphocytic O
pleocytosis O
(18-20 O
WBC, O
56-69% O
lymphocytes, O
29-40% O
monocytes, O
and O
2-4% O
neutrophils) O
and O
0-1 O
RBC. O
CSF O
ACE O
was O
normal. O
Cultures O
were O
negative. O
CSF O
VDRL O
was O
negative. O
Because O
she O
has O
a O
history O
of O
sarcoidosis, O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
this O
likely O
represented O
neurosarcoidosis. O
She O
was O
started O
on O
prednisone O
40 O
mg O
daily. O
Her O
daughter O
has O
noted O
some O
improvement O
in O
her O
movements O
and O
cognition O
since O
starting O
the O
prednisone, O
but O
she O
remains O
abnormal. O
She O
has O
lowered O
the O
prednisone O
to O
10 O
mg O
daily O
now. O
Reviewing O
the O
laboratory O
studies O
today, O
I O
see O
that O
although O
an O
RPR O
was O
non-reactive, O
a O
TA-IgG O
was O
positive, O
and O
the O
confirming O
treponemal O
tests O
(FTA) O
was O
also O
positive O
at O
the O
state O
lab. O
She O
and O
her O
daughter O
are O
aware O
of O
no O
prior O
history O
of O
syphilis. O
Other O
studies O
during O
her O
hospitalization O
included O
low O
serum O
Na O
(133) O
and O
Mg O
(1.3), O
normal O
vitamin O
B12, O
folate, O
TSH, O
and O
ESR O
(20). O
CSF O
HSV O
PCR O
was O
negative. O
HbA1C B-DIABETES

She O
has O
a O

According O
to O
her O

she O
had O
a O
skin O
lesion O
excised O
from O
near O
her O
left O

about O
two O
years O
ago. O
Apparently, O
this O
showed O
noncaseated O
granuloma, O
and O
that O
is O

the O
diagnosis O
of O

was O
first O
made. O
She O
then O
had O

Her O
treponemal O
test O
for O
syphilis O
came O
back O
positive O
from O
the O
hospitalization O
in O
July. O
Since O
syphilis, O
too, O
could O
cause O
noncaseating O
granulomas, O
and O
she O
has O
clearly O
has O
syphilis O
at O
some O
point O
in O
the O
past O
which O
was O
probably O
untreated, O
this O
raises O
some O
doubt O
about O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis. O
I O
will O
review O
that O
issue O
with O
you O
and O
with O
Dr, O
Villalpando. B-PHI
She O
had O
CSF O
pleocytosis O
in O
July. O
With O
that O
and O
the O
positive O
treponemal O
test O
(FTA), O
she O
will O
need O
a O
full O
course O
of O
intravenous O
penicillin O
for O
presumed O
neurosyphilis. O
I O
will O
discuss O
arrangements O
for O
possible O
outpatient O
management O
of O
hatt O
with O
a O
PICC O
line O
and O
outpatient O
VNA O
services. O
Concerning O
her O
need O
for O
prednisone, O
I O
think O
that O
will O
depend O
on O
our O
interpretation O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis O
in O
light O
of O
this O
new O
diagnosis. O
If O
the O
evidence O
of O
sarcoidosis O
is O
not O
strong O
with O
this O
alternative O
diagnosis, O
then O
we O
can O
plan O
to O
complete O
the O
course O
of O
penicillin O
and O
taper O
and O
discontinue O
the O
prednisone O
and O
then O
follow O
her O
clinical O
course, O
her O
CSF, O
and O
her O
syphilis O
serologies. O
Finally, O
from O
the O
MRI O
of O
7/28, O
shows O
a O
couple O
of O
tiny O
foci O
of O
restricted O
diffusion O
in O
the O
left O
thalamus. O
These O
are O
most O
consistent O
with O
small O
vessel O
ischemic O
strokes. O
She O
has O
multiple O
risk O
factors O
for O
common O
small O
vessel O
disease O
and O
stroke, O
but O
in O
the O
context O
of O
her O
inflammatory O
CSF O
and O
evidence O
of O
prior O
syphilis, O
we O
must O
also O
consider O
cerebrovascular O
syphilis O
as O
the O
likely O
cause O
of O
this. O
I O
would O
recommend O
treatment O
now O
with O
a O
14-day O
course O
of O
high-dose O
(20-24 O
million O
units O
a O
day) O
penicillin. O
She O
is O
already O
on O
prednisone O
which O
might O
help O
to O
prevent O
any O
possible O
Jarisch-Herxheimer O
reaction. O
I O
think O
that O
if O
she O
remains O
stable O
after O
the O
initiation O
of O
her O
PCN O
therapy, O
then O
we O
can O
plan O
to O
taper O
and O
then O
discontinue O
the O
prednisone, O
to O
follow O
her O
clinically O
and O
with O
repeated O
LP, O
and O
determine O
any O
need O
for O
future O
corticosteroid O
therapy O
on O
her O
course. O

you O
for O

Dear O
Usha: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
one O
of O
your O
clinic O
patients, O
Ms. O
Wonda B-PHI
Benitez, I-PHI
in O
my O
cardiovascular O
clinic O
for O
follow-up O
status O
post B-CAD
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
bypass I-CAD
surgery I-CAD
and O
pounding O
headaches. O
As O
you O
know, O
we O
performed O
a O
persantine B-CAD
MIBI B-CAD
recently I-CAD
which I-CAD
showed I-CAD
inferior B-CAD
wall I-CAD
ischemia. I-CAD
I O
wasn't O
sure O
whether O
or O
not O
this O
ischemia O
was O
new. O
On O
review O
of O
her O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
surgery O
notes, O
she O
did O
not O
have O
her O
totally O
occluded O
right O
coronary O
artery O
bypass. O
Therefore, O
I O
suggest O
that O
this O
reversible O
ischemia O
in O
the O
inferior O
wall O
is O
probably O
old O
and O
was O
the O
result O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
did O
not O
bypass O
this O
area. O
She O
did O
have O
a O
LIMA B-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
and I-CAD
two I-CAD
saphenous I-CAD
venous I-CAD
grafts I-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
circumflex I-CAD
territory, I-CAD
the I-CAD
OM I-CAD
and I-CAD
the I-CAD
diagonal. I-CAD
She O
has O
been O
doing O
relatively O
well O
with O
chest O
discomfort O
and O
I O
recommended O
we O
continue O
her O
current O
cardiac O
medications. O
However, O
she O
has O
been O
complaining O
of O
pounding O
headaches O
and O
she O
did O
have O
a O
history O
of O
otitis O
media O
in O
her O
right O
ear. O
Therefore, O
I O
think O
it O
wouldn't O
be O
unreasonable O
to O
refer O
her O
to O
ENT O
to O
have O
them O
evaluate O
her O
ears O
as O
a O
possible O
source O
of O
her O
pounding O
headaches. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
have O
suggested O
that O
she O
take O
her O
nifedipine B-MEDICATION
and O
nitroglycerin B-MEDICATION
in O
the O
event O
that O
her O
blood O
pressure O
shoots O
up O
during O
these O
episodes. O
I O
suspect O
that O
her O
blood O
pressure O
rise O
during O
these O
episodes O
is O
due O
more O
to O
anxiety O
than O
to O
intrinsic O
problem O
with O
her O
cardiovascular O
system. O
She O
will O
return O
to O
see O
me O
in O
follow-up O
in O
three O
months O
time, O
at O
which O
time O
I O
will O
check O
her O
cholesterol O
level. O
Again, O
thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
your O
patient. O
Please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
call O
me O
if O
you O
have O
any O
questions. O

Peggy O

was O
seen O
in O
the O
Renal O
Clinic O
today. O
Her O
chief O
symptomatic O
complaint O
is O
severe O
pruritus, O
which O
has O
not O
improved O
much O
with O
Benadryl. O
She O
has O
yet O
to O
fill O
the O
prescription O
for O
Sarna O
lotion. O
Her O
diarrhea O
has O
improved O
with O
Imodium, O
and O
she O
brought O

today. O
Her O
appetite O
has O

On O
examination, O
weight O
was O
46.8 O
kilos, O
which O
is O
stable. O
Heart O
rate O
was O
72, O
blood O
pressure O
130/64. O
JVP O
was O
clearly O
seen O
at O
6 O

the O
sternal O
angle, O
and O
there O
was O
1 O
plus O
peripheral O
edema. O
There O
was O
no O
S3. O
Chest O
examination O
revealed O
bibasilar O
inspiratory O
crackles. O
Her O
left O
hand O
is O
no O
longer O
cold, O
but O
the O
PTFE O
graft O
remains O
slightly O
edematous. O

Patient O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
a O
routine O
follow O
up O
of O
her O
blood O
pressure, O
as O
well O
as O
routine O
baseline O
examinations. O
On O
her O
last O
visit, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
was O
160/90, B-HYPERTENSION
and O
on O
check O
today O
it O
was O
150/90. B-HYPERTENSION
We O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
that O
she O
continue O
her O
salt-restricted O
diet. O
We O
also O
discussed O
that O
she O
continue O
her O
own O
exercise, O
both O
of O
which O
she O
does O
faithfully, O
and O
we O
also O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
of O
her O
trying O
to O
gradually O
lose O
weight. O
She O
currently O
weighs O
199 O
lbs. O
and O
stands O
approximately O
4'9' O
tall. O
As O
far O
as O
long-term O
prognosis, O
my O
current O
plan O
is O
to O
evaluate O
her O
blood O
pressure O
on O
another O
subsequent O
visit O
in O
the O
next O
6-8 O
weeks O
and O
at O
that O
time O
if O
it O
is O
elevated, O
we O
will O
consider O
either O
going O
up O
on O
her O
nifedipine O
XL O
dose O
or O
going O
up O
on O
her O
furosemide O
medicine, O
seeing O
if O
we O
can O
possibly O
gain O
some O
better O
control O
or O
possibly O
adding O
another O
agent. O
However, O
at O
this O
point O
she O
seems O
to O
be O
doing O
much O
better O
with O
this O
new O
blood O
pressure O
and O
this O
is O
significant O
improvement O
maintenance O
from O
her O
previous O
blood O
pressure O
on O
her O
first O
admission, O
which O
was O
systolic O
blood O
pressures O
in O
the O
200s-190s. B-HYPERTENSION
Her O
family O
situation O
which O
was O
somewhat O
unstable O
at O
her O
first O
presentation O
now O
appears O
to O
be O
much O
more O
stable. O
She O
is O
currently O
living O
with O
her O
mother O
and O
she O
says O
that O
she O
she O
is O
enjoying O
her O
new O
sense O
of O
feeling O
good O
about O
her O
self O
with O

to O

Dear O
Dr. O
Easterling: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Brian O
Martin O
in O
the O
Cardiology O
Service O
on O
10/28/2078. O
He O
has O
a O
history O
of O
chest O

and O
was O
evaluated O
at O
Klickitat O
Valley O
Hospital O
for O
the O
same O
by O
you O
and, O
I O
believe, O
Dr. O
Inglis. O
He O
reportedly O
had O
an O

a O

that O
were O
unconcerning. O
His O
episodes O
of O
chest O
pain O
are O
interesting. O
He O
feels O
a O
sharp O
pain O
for O
maybe O
a O
second O
or O
two O
in O
his O
chest O
followed O
by O
rapid O
palpitations O
associated O
with O
some O
jaw O
aching. O
The O
palpitations O
are O
of O
sudden O
onset O
as O
well O
as O
sudden O
offset. O
They O
were O
occurring O
up O
to O
one O

through O
his O

at O
Klickitat O
Valley O
a O
couple O

Assessment O
and O
plan: O
Mr. O
Martin O
has O
episodic O
palpitations O
associated O
with O
some O
chest O
discomfort. O
Sometimes O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
patients O
to O
distinguish O
between O
palpitations O
and O
chest O
pain O
per O
se. O
It O
may O
also O
be O
that O
his O
palpitations O
raise O
his O
heart O
rate O
to O
the O
point O
where O
he O
becomes O
ischemic, O
notwithstanding O
the O
negative O
stress O
test O
that O
he O
had O
in O
the O
past. O
We O
will O
request O
the O
records O
of O
the O
echo O
and O
the O
stress O
test O
so O
we O
can O
have O
them O
for O
our O
files O
here O
and O
I O
have O
asked O
him O
to O
complete O
a O
30-day O

recording O
and O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
after O
that O

he O

The O

he O

noted O
tightness O
in O
his O

He O
later O
developed O
progressive O

that O

upset O
that O
I O

that O

I O
have O
arranged O

and O
he O
reports O
that O

never O

When O
it O
hits O

he O

Mrs. O
Fallon O
returns O
to O

management O
of O
a O
right O
posterior O
ankle O
ulceration. O
Since O
her O
last O

she O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Frederick O
Archer O
who O
admitted O
her O

which O
revealed O
that O

to O
heal O
the O
ulceration. O
PHYSICAL O

man O
who O
is O
a O
convenience O
store O
manager. O
He O
has O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
with O
his O
right O
knee O
over O
the O
years, O
mainly O
related O
to O
sports O
injuries. O
He O
has O
had O
in O
particular O
2 O
years O
of O
pain O
now O
in O
his O
right O
knee. O
It O
got O
so O
bad O
6 O
months O
ago O
that O
he O
required O
large O
amounts O
of O
ibuprofen O
to O
relieve O
that. O
It O
has O
slowly O
got O
better O
since O
then. O
At O
present O
his O
main O
problem O
is O
pain O
in O
the O
knee O
which O
mainly O
occurs O
with O
activity O
but O
he O
also O
has O
rest O
and O
night O
pain. O
He O
has O
a O
restricted O
walking O
distance. O
With O
regard O
to O
function, O
he O
is O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
his O
work O
with O
difficulty O
and O
requires O
periods O
of O
rest O
in O
the O
evening O
on O
returning O
home O
from O
work. O
He O
has O
noticed O
his O
knee O
is O
becoming O
slowly O
more O
bowed. O
With O
regard O
to O
treatment O
he O
has O
is O
taking O
regular O
analgesia O
in O
the O
form O
of O
Tylenol O
but O
has O
recently O
noticed O
blood O
in O
his O
stool O
for O
which O
he O
is O
going O
to O
have O
a O
colonoscopy O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
He O
has O
not O
tried O
any O
canes O
and O
has O
not O
had O
any O
physical O
therapy O
as O
yet. O
On O
examination O
I O
note O
he O
has O
bilateral O
varus O
knees, O
worse O
on O
the O
right O
than O
the O
left. O
He O
has O
an O
antalgic O
gait O
and O
marked O
varus O
thrust. O
He O
has O
a O
marked O
effusion O
that O
does O
not O
have O
any O
gross O
swelling O
indicative O
of O
arthritis. O
He O
has O
a O
5 O
degree O
fixed O
flexion O
deformity O
and O
flexes O
up O
to O
115 O
degrees. O
His O
varus O
deformity O
is O
not O
fully O
correctable. O
He O
has O
grade O
5 O
quadriceps O
power. O
X-rays O
reveal O
marked O
degenerative O
changes O
in O
his O
right O
knee O
with O
complete O
obliteration O
of O
joint O
space O
on O
the O
right O
side. O
I O
note O
he O
also O
has O
changes O
in O
his O
left O
knee O
indicative O
of O
medial O
compartment O
arthritis O
but O
his O
left O
knee O
is O
currently O
asymptomatic. O
We O
have O
discussed O
the O
operative O
options O
for O
him O
which O
consist O
of O
high O
tibial O
osteotomy, O
a O
unicompartmental O
knee O
replacement, O
and O
a O
total O
knee O
replacement. O
At O
present O
neither O
he O
not O
Dr. O
Oates O
feels O
that O
his O
symptoms O
are O
severe O
enough O
to O
warrant O
operative O
intervention. O
We O
would O
certainly O
reconsider O
should O
he O
run O
into O
trouble O
in O
the O
next O
few O
months O
aspirating O
his O
knee, O
instilling O
some O
corticosteroids. O
We O
have O
advised O
him O
that O
this O
will O
only O
provide O
him O
with O
short O
term O
relief O
but O
may O
allow O
him O
enough O
relief O
to O
begin O
some O
walking O
and O
fitness O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
lose O
some O
weight. O
We O
have O
organized O
to O
see O
him O
again O
in O
4-6 O
month's O
time O
at O
which O
stage O
we O
will O
reassess O
him. O
Should O
he O
run O
into O
trouble O
in O
the O
meantime O
he O
cal O
certainly O
ring O
up O
and O
make O
an O
appointment O
to O
come O
and O
see O
us O
and O
we O
will O
aspirate O
the O
knee O
and O
instill O
some O
corticosteroid. O
With O
kind O
regards. O
Yours O
sincerely, O

Dear O
Dr. O
Stafford: O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
provide O
a O
cardiologic O
evaluation O
on O
Mrs. O
Tinsley O
with O
a O
concentration O
on O
her O
appropriateness O
to O
be O
listed O
as O
a O
recipient O
for O
a O
cadaver O
renal O
transplant. O
In O
summary, O
she O
is O
a O
46 O
year O
old O
woman O
who O
has O
been O
an O
insulin B-DIABETES
dependent I-DIABETES
diabetic B-DIABETES
since O
the O
age O
of O
29 O
and O
has O
been O
on O
hemodialysis O
since O
2083. O
By O
report, O
her O
other O
complications O
for O
diabetes B-DIABETES
include O
retinopathy, O
peripheral O
neuropathy, O
and O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease. O
In O
viewing O
her O
present O
history, O
she O
works O
in O
the O
Houghton O
Mifflin O
Harcourt O
learning O
technology O
department. O
Her O
three O
times O
a O
week O
hemodialyses O
are O
uncomplicated. O
She O
does, O
however, O
experience O
occasional O
chest O
pressure O
with O
activities O
and O
on O
rare O
occasions O
has O
had O
nocturnal B-CAD
angina. B-CAD
These O
episodes O
are O
relieved O
by O
nitroglycerin. B-CAD
Mrs. O
Tinsley O
has O
also O
noted O
that O
with O
walking O
she O
will O
occasionally O
get O
short O
of O
breath O
which O
is O
relieved O
by O
slowing O
down. O
In O
addition O
to O
diabetes O
and O
hypertension B-HYPERTENSION
which O
was O

only O

she O
has O
been O

A O
report O
of O
an O

from O
April O
of O
2083, O
shows O
mild O
ventricular O
hypertrophy O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
mitral O
insufficiency, O
preserved O

She O
had O
an O
exercise O

in O
February O
of O
2085. O
On O
a O
modified O
protocol, O
she O
went O

4 O

minutes. O
This O
is O
equivalent O
to O

That O

accompanied O
by O
both O

perfusion O
changes O
in O
the O

consistent O

As O
was O
apparent O
to O
those O
involved, O
even O
the O
non-isotope O
portion O
alone O
was O
worrisome O
for O
high O

coronary B-CAD
disease I-CAD
and O
led O
to O
the O
recommendation O
for O
a O
cardiac O

That O
study O
was O
done O
in O
Macdonald O

and O
at O
this O
time, O
I O
only O
have O
the O
report. O
However, O
from O
this O
report, O
there O
was O
preserved O
LV O

with O
anterior O

is O

until I-CAD
an I-CAD

The I-CAD
circumflex I-CAD
was I-CAD
also I-CAD
diffusely I-CAD
diseased I-CAD
and I-CAD
there I-CAD
was I-CAD
a I-CAD
discrete I-CAD
stenosis I-CAD
in I-CAD
the I-CAD
mid I-CAD
section I-CAD
of I-CAD
a I-CAD
large I-CAD

The I-CAD
right I-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
was I-CAD
diffusely I-CAD
diseased I-CAD
with I-CAD
a I-CAD
discrete I-CAD
stenosis. I-CAD
At O
that O
time, O
the O
recommendation O
was O
to O
continue O
medical O
therapy. O
Her O
medical O
therapy O
at O
this O
time O
is O
estrogen O
replacement O
with O
prempro O
2.5 O

once O
a O

one O
every O
other O

in O
addition O
to O
her O
supplemental O
vitamins, O

and O
twice O

insulin B-MEDICATION
therapy. I-MEDICATION
In O
rounding O
out O
her O
medical O
history, O
her O
surgical O
procedures O
have O
involved O
the O
hemodialysis O
access. O
She O
has O
had O
one O
pregnancy O
28 O
years O
ago O
without O
complications. O
I O
also O
elicited O
a O
history O
of O
some O
focal O
arm O
weakness O
and O
occasional O
slurring O
of O
speech. O
This O
was O
difficult O
to O
pin O
down, O
but O
is O
of O
some O
concern. O
On O
exam, O
her O
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
150/80 B-HYPERTENSION
mm I-HYPERTENSION
Hg, I-HYPERTENSION
pulse O
90 O
regular, O
her O
weight O
95 O
lbs. O
Her O
hemodialysis O
shunt O
is O
on O
the O
left O
arm. O
There O
was O
a O
right O
carotid O
bruit, O
neck O
veins O
were O
not O
distended. O
Lungs O
were O
clear, O
PMI O
was O
displaced O
and O
sustained. O
There O
was O
an O
S4, O
no O
S3 O
and O
there O
was O
a O
holo O
systolic O
murmur O
at O
the O
apex. O
Abdomen O
was O
benign, O
femoral O
pulses O
were O
intact, O
extremities O
were O
without O
edema. O
The O
electrocardiogram O
showed O
sinus O
rhythm, O
diffuse O
STT O
changes. O
There O
were O
no O
pathologic O
Q O
waves. O
Although O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
evaluation O
was O
originally O
for O
transplant O
candidacy, O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
her O
current O
cardiac O
status. O
She O
is O
a O
young O
diabetic O
woman, O
symptomatic O
of O
both O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
chest O
pain O
and O
on O
exercise O
test, O
has O
limited O
functional O
capacity. O
The O
coronary O
angiography O
reveals O
a O
presence O
of O
multi-vessel O
disease. O
Even O
without O
seeing O
the O
primary O
data O
which O
I O
hope O
to O
do O
in O
the O
next O
week, O
it O
would O
be O
unlikely O
that O
she O
would O
be O
an O
angioplasty O
candidate, O
given O
the O
poor O
results O
in O
diabetics. B-DIABETES
Therefore, O
coronary O
revascularization O
for O
her O
would O
be O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
surgery. O
Obviously, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
review O
the O
films O
first, O
and O
speak O
with O
Dr. O
Upson O
regarding O
augmentation O
of O
her O
anti-anginals. O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
add O
pravastatin O
at O
this O
time, O
starting O
with O
only O
10 O
mg O
and O
obtain O
non-invasive O
studies O
of O
the O
carotids. O
As O
indicated, O
although O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
evaluation O
was O
her O
suitability O
for O
transplantation, O
the O
issue O
of O
controlling O
symptomatic B-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
in O
this O
young O
woman O
became O
more O
pressing. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
working O
with O
you O
and O
the O
other O
physicians O
in O
her O
care. O

Patricia O
is O
a O
70-year-old O
retired O
woman, O
right-hand O
dominant, O
who O
comes O
with O
complaints O
of O
soreness O
in O
her O
right O
wrist. O
She O
apparently O
had O
a O
fall, O
which O
caused O
substantial O
pain O
and O
some O
swelling, O
but O
no O
bruising. O
Brought O
her O
in O
to O
have O
an O
evaluation. O
X-rays O
showed O
no O
fracture O
and O
over O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
things O
have O
improved O
substantially, O
and O
she O
comes O
in O
just O
because O
she O
was O
told O
to O
get O
it O
checked O
out O
by O
her O
doctors, O
but O
otherwise O
feeling O
quite O
good O
and O
wondering O
if O
the O
appointment O
is O
even O
necessary. O
Past O
medical O
history O
includes O
high B-HYPERTENSION
blood I-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
and O
diabetes. B-DIABETES
No O
prior O
surgeries. O
No O
medications. O
No O

Lists O
no O
family O
history O
of O
any O
problems. O
Lives O
alone O
and O
used O
to O
smoke, O
but O
quit. O
On O
examination, O
she O
has O
full O
range O
of O
motion O
of O
her O
wrist O
compared O
to O
the O
opposite O
side. O
No O
atrophy, O
ecchymosis, O

or O
deformity. O
Negative O
scaphoid O
shift O
test. O
Slight O
tenderness O
over O
the O
distal O
radius. O
Normal O
tendon O
function. O
My O
impression O
is O
that O
she O
must O
have O
got O
a O
mild O
sprain, O
which O
has O
recovered O
or O
possibly O
even O
a O
nondisplaced O
fracture O
given O
her O
age O
and O
osteoporotic O
bone, O
but O
whatever O
this O
was, O
it O
has O
resolved O
almost O
entirely, O
she O
is O
functioning O
well, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
apparent O
problem, O
so O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
as O
needed. O
