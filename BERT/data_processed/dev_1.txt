is O
unable O
to O

when O
she O

noted O
her O
lower O

swelling. O
She O
states O
that O
approximately O
1 O
year O

to O
arrival O
she O
had O
to O
throw O
out O
all O
of O
her O
shoes O
except O
for O

change O
in O
her O

has O
had O
a O

Kadeem O
Vicente O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
follow O
up O
office O
visit. O
The O
patient O
is O
seen O
primarily O
for O
follow O
up O
regarding O
his O
history O
of O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
(the B-CAD
patient I-CAD
is I-CAD
status I-CAD
post I-CAD
inferior I-CAD
wall I-CAD
MI), I-CAD
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy O
and O
to O
a O
much O
lesser O
extent O
osteoarthritis. O
The O
patient O
is O
also O
followed O
GERD-like O
symptoms. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
latter, O
the O
patient O
notes O
that O
since O
he O
has O
been O
off O
the O
Zantac, O
he O
initially O
saw O
no O
change O
in O
his O
ability O
to O
handle O
foods; O
however, O
he O
now O
notes O
that O
he O
is O
starting O
to O
get O
some O
reflux O
and O
feels O
slightly O
uncomfortable O
with O
this. O
He O
denies O
chest O
pain O
per O
se O
and O
any O
symptoms O
pertinent O
to O
cardiovascular O
disease, O
such O
as O
chest O
heaviness, O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
diaphoresis, O
nausea. O
The O
patient O
knows O
the O
foods O
that O
give O
him O
this O
type O
of O
reaction, O
such O
as O
tomato O
based O
sauces O
and O
tries O
to O
avoid O
them O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
The O
patient O
is O
asking O
me O
about O
Prilosec O
which O
he O
recently O
read O
in O
the O
Journal O
and O
was O
wandering O
whether O
this O
would O
be O
a O
suitable O
alternative O
to O
H2 O
blockers O
(Patient O
had O
been O
on O
H2 O
blockers O
for O
many O
years O
without O
a O
trial O
off O
of O
them, O
which O
a O
reason O
that O
we O
stopped O
his O
H2 O
blocker O
therapy O
recently). O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
patient's O
symptoms O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
the O
patient O
says O
that O
these O
have O
almost O
completely O
resolved O
on O
the O
4 O
mg O
of O
Hytrin O
and O
which O
he O
will O
continue O
taking. O
The O
patient O
does O
remain O
on O
Zestril B-MEDICATION
for O
his O
hypertension O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Hytrin O
and O
the O
blood O
pressure O
gotten O
by O
the O
nurse O
today B-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
150/80 B-HYPERTENSION
and O
repeated O
by O
me O
20 O
minutes O
later O
was O
130/74. O
The O
patient O
reports O
being O
otherwise O
well, O
no O
new O
symptoms. O
No O

PLAN: O

year O
old O
man O
with O
multiple O
medical O
concerns O
comes O
in O
for O
follow O
up. O
1. O
Hypertension. O
The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
Zestril, O
once O
a O
day O
as O
well O
as O
his O
Hytrin, O
which O
he O
uses O
also O
for O
BPH. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
appears O
to O
be O
well O
controlled O
on O
this O
regimen. O
One O
of O
the O
issues O
would O
be O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
patient O
should O
be O
on O
a O
beta-blocker. O
The O
patient O
verbally O
has O
a O
history O
of O
'a O
silent O
heart O
attack' O
and O
there O
is O
evidence B-CAD
of I-CAD
an I-CAD
inferior I-CAD
wall I-CAD
MI I-CAD
and O
this O
is O
certainly O
an O
option O
we O
will O
consider O
in O
the O
future, O
although O
I O
would O
not O
add O
a O
third O
anti-hypertensive O
regimen O
and O
would O
most O
likely O
replace O
his O
Zestril O
with O
a O
beta-blocker. O
2. O
GERD. O
The O
patient O
will O
be O
given O
a O
prescription O
for O
Prilosec O
20 O
mg O
to O
be O
taken O
at O
bedtime. O
The O

that O
we O
can O

this O
for O
the O
next O
2-3 O
months, O
although O
he O
should O
be O
able O
to O
experience O
relief O
almost O
immediately. O
The O
patient O
does O
have O
a O
known O
hiatal O
hernia, O
which O
may O
also O
contribute O
to O
his O
symptoms O
of O
chronic O
reflux. O

BPH O
- O
The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
4 O
mg O
of O
Hytrin, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
working O
quite O
well. O
The O
patient O
notes O
that O
there O
is O
less O
dribbling, O
less O
nocturnal O
urination. O
The O
patient O
does O
take O
Lasix O
20 O
mg O
once O
a O
day O
for O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
did O
not O
have O
any O
difficulty O
with O
urination O
after O
he O
takes O
the O
diuretic. O
4. O
Insomnia. O
The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
Ambien O
10 O
mg O
which O
he O
takes O
on O
a O
q.h.s. O
basis. O
The O
patient O
was O
formerly O
on O
Amitriptyline O
but O
was O
told O
that O
the O
secondary O
side O
effects O
which O
can O
include O
EKG O
changes O
and O
at O
this O
point O
tells O
me O
that O
the O
Ambien O
works O
and O
he O
would O
like O
to O
stay O
on O
this. O
Patient O
has O
enough O
to O
last O
until O
I O
see O
him O
next O
time. O
I O
will O
thus O
see O
the O
patient O
in O
3 O
months O
for O
a O
fasting O
lipid O
(The O
patient's O
lipid O
profile O
thus O
far O
has O
been O
acceptable. O
The O
cholesterol O
is O
190 O
and O
an O
acceptable O
triglyceride; O
however, O
I O
do O
want O
to O
assess O
the O
patient's O
LDL O
and O
HDL O
before O
making O
any O

with O

treatment. O

These O

occur O
on O

her O
to O
more O

try O
to O
lower O
her O
caloric O

and O
increase O
her O
aerobic O
activity O
level. O
In O

I O
have O
asked O

at O

then O
I O
would O
consider O
initiating O

In O

AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Ms. O

woman O
who O
comes O

with O
review O
of O
her O

diabetes. I-DIABETES
She O
is O
doing O
much O
better O
on O
the O
pump O
than O
she O
was O
before O
especially O
with O
the O
recent O
adjustments O
we O
made. O
We O
will O
continue O
with O
the O

she O
will O
continue O
to O
send O
me O
her O
blood O
sugars O
every O

continue O
with O
this. O
3. O
Neck O
pain. O
Intermittent O
neck O
pain O
is O
most O
likely O
from O
degenerative O
disease. O
I O
did O
not O
find O
anything O
on O
neurological O
exam O
that O
was O
concerning. O
I O
did O
encourage O
her O
to O
actually O
take O
some O
Naprosyn O
as O
needed O
for O
this O
pain, O
but O
not O
to O
take O
it O
on O
a O
continuous O
basis O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time. O
She O
has O
had O
some O
problems O
with O
some O
blood O
in O
the O
stool O
and O
I O
feel O
that O
she O
is O
due O
for O
colonoscopy. O
I O
did O
recommend O
that O
she O
get O
one O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
ADDENDUM: O
A O
pelvic O
exam O
was O

taken. O
Greater O
than O
50% O
of O
our O
60-minute O
visit O
was O
spent O
going O
over O
her O
pump O
settings, O
the O
appropriate O
levels O
for O
her O
pump, O
going O
over O
her O
diet, O
going O
over O
her O
bowel O
habits O
and O
her O
etiology O
of O
possible O
blood O
in O
her O

had O
a O
colonoscopy O
in O
2125 O
and O
was O
told O
to O
come O
back O
in O
2130 O

His O
Pneumovax O
is O
due O
to O
be O
a O

time. O
We O
are O
recommending O
a O
PSA O

We O
will O
recommend O
a O
followup O
in O
1 O
year O
for O
an O
annual O
physical. O

now O
eliminated O

from O
his O
diet, O
although O
I O
do O
suspect O
dietary O
noncompliance O
beyond O

sugar. O
Recommend O
checking O
a O
hemoglobin O

today, O
urine O
for O
microalbumin, O
lipid O
panel O
and O
creatinine O
as O
well O
as O
a O

a O
GFR. O
I O
would O
recommend O
continuing O
his O
insulin O
NPH O
42 O
units O
daily, O
but O
we O
may O
need O
to O
recommend O
an O
endocrine O
consult O
if O
his O
A1c O
remains O
elevated O
despite O
dietary O
improvement. O
We O
did O
recommend O
aggressive O
weight O
loss O
and O
exercise O
as O
this O
is O
a O
major O
impediment O
to O
his O

control. O
I O
would O
recommend O
follow O
up O
in O
3 O

Obesity. B-OBESE
We O
will O
check O
a O

to O
ensure O
that O
he O
is O
in O
good O
metabolic O
balance. O
I O
do O
suspect O

given O
his O

He O

We O
would O
like O
to O
strive O
for O
an O

I O
would O
recommend O

she O
had O
some O
mild O
weight O

However, O
she O
had O
been O
trying O

She O
had O
no O
respiratory O
symptoms O
of O
dyspnea O
or O

A O
chest O
x-ray O
was O
obtained, O
which O
revealed O
a O
6 O
cm O
left O
lung O
mass. O
The O
patient O
subsequently O
had O
a O
CT O
scan. O
The O
CT O

6 O
lung O
mass O
in O
the O
posterior O
subsegment O
of O
the O
right O
upper O
lobe. O
There O
were O
some O
modestly O

LABORATORY O
DATA: O
Spirometry O
is O
normal. O
IMAGING O
STUDIES: O
A O
chest O
CT O
is O
as O
noted. O
IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
A O
75-year-old O
with O
a O
large O
right O
lung O
mass. O
This O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
malignant, O
although O
a O
nonmalignant O
process O
or O
inflammatory O
processes O
are O
remotely O
possible. O
At O
this O
point, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
her O
for O
a O
PET O
CT O
scan. O
Her O
small O
nodules O
in O
her O
lung O
fields O
bilaterally O
are O
all O
sub O
5mm O
and O
may O
not O
be O
related O
to O
this O
malignancy. O
She O
does O
have O
modestly O
enlarged O
hilar O
nodes. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
her O
to O
Thoracic O
Surgery O
for O
consideration O
of O
a O
mediastinoscopy O
and O
potential O
resection. O
She O
would O
likely O
require O
cardiac O
clearance O
before O
this O
would O
occur. O
She O
can O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
after O
her O
surgery O
if O
this O
proves O
to O
be O
an O
inflammatory O
lung O
disorder. O
Otherwise, O
she O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
Oncology. O
If O
she O
was O
deemed O
not O
to O
be O
an O
appropriate O
surgical O
candidate, O
either O
because O
of O
metastatic O
disease O
or O
because O
of O
comorbidity, O
she O
could O
have O
this O
lesion O
biopsied O
via O
a O
transthoracic O
needle O
aspirate. O

she O
has O
had O
substantial O

She O
continues O
to O
admit O
to O

but O
no O

is I-HYPERTENSION

and O
her O
heart O
rate O
is O
in O
the O
low O
60s. O
She O
is O
comfortable O
seated O
on O
the O
exam O
table. O
Her O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
is O
approximately O
8 O
cm O
with O
prominent O
V O
waves. O
There O
are O
very O
rare O
crackles O
at O
the O
bases. O
Cardiac O
exam O
reveals O
a O
nondisplaced O
PMI O
with O
regular O
rate O
and O
rhythm, O
normal O
intensity O
S1 O
and O
S2. O
P2 O
is O
increased. O
There O
is O
a O
grade O
3/6 O
holosystolic O
murmur, O
loudest O
at O
the O
apex. O
She O
has O
no O
edema O
of O
the O
extremities O
and O
they O
are O
warm O
to O
touch. O
Her O
ECG O
reveals O
sinus O

with O
normal O
axis O
intervals. O
There O
is O
nonspecific O
ST O
abnormality, O
unchanged O
from O
her O
tracing O
in O
August. O
In O
summary, O
Ms. O
Yerger O
remains O
free O
of O
recurrent O
angina O
or O
heart O
failure O
symptoms. O
She O
does O
have O
evident O
persistent O
elevated O
right O
cardiac O
pressures O
on O
exam O
that O
may O
be O
related O
to O
her O
underlying O
pulmonary O
disease. O
In O
light O
of O
her O
systolic O
hypertension, O
we O
increased O
her O
Toprol O
to O
150 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
She O
will O
have O
her O
blood O

checked O
in O
the O
coming O
week O
and O
call O
the O
result O
to O
me. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
seeing O
her O
again O
in O
approximately O
six O
months. O
It O
remains O
a O
pleasure O
being O
involved O
in O
this O

Dr. O

because O
of O
absent O

Androgel O

She O

more O

no O

The O

the O

She O
states O

that O
her O

She O
has O
not O

in O

She O
ordinarily O
has O
a O
bowel O
movement O
once O
every O

weeks. O
She O
takes O
nothing O
to O
move O
her O
bowels O
and O
she O
is O
extraordinarily O
upset O
about O
her O
daughter O
who O
is O
homeless. O
She O
has O
provided O
for O
her O
daughter, O
helped O
her O
get O
a O
job, O
and O
the O
daughter O
is O
emotionally O
ill, O
and O
I O
have O
advised O
the O
patient O
that O
she O
should O
be O
in O
a O
mental O
institution. O
The O
patient O
no O
longer O
care O
for O
her O
daughter O
and O
her O
daughter O
cares O
nothing O
about O
her O
father O
and O
mother. O
It O
is O
a O
hopeless O
situation O
and O
45 O
minutes O
were O
spent O
in O
discussion O
of O
the O
daughter's O
illness O
and O
what O
the O
patient O
would O
do O
about O
this. O
I O
have O
told O
her O
to O
use O
some O
Dulcolax O
suppositories O
and O
Dulcolax O
by O
mouth O
for O
probable O
impacted O
feces, O
although O
this O
is O
not O
an O
uncommon O
thing O
for O
her O
and O
I O
have O
ordered O
a O
set O
of O
blood O
tests O
to O
check O
on O
her B-DIABETES
diabetes, B-DIABETES
kidney O
function, O
etc. O
She O
has O
a O
good O
physician O
in O
Maine O
where O
she O
is O
planning O
to O
move O
in O
June O
and O
she O
will O
return O
to O
me O
next O

for O
a O
complete O
physical. O
She O
does O
have O
diabetic O

Her O

She O
no O

on O

She O
no O

has O
any O

She O

her. O

History O
of O
present O
illness O
The O
patient O
has O
done O
very O
well O
over O
the O
last O
year. O
He O
has O
maintained O
his O
weight, O
which O
has O
been O
quite O
difficult O
given O
the O
social O
commitments O
that O
he O
has. O
He O
is O
requiring O
to O
eat O
out O
quite O
a O
bit. O
He O
has O
also O
done O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
traveling O
over O
the O
last O
three O
to O
four O
months. O
This O
caused O
him O
to O
be O
more O
exhausted O
than O
usual. O
His O
incarcerated O
hernia O
repair O
has O
stood O
up. O
He O
has O
some O
discomfort O
occasionally O
in O
that O
area, O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
feels O
that O
this O
is O
back O
to O
normal. O
He O
is O
careful O
with O
his O
diet O
as O
much O
as O
he O
can O
be. O
He O
had O
a O
cold O
over O
the O
last O

or O
so. O
It O
slowly O
resolved. O

I O
think O
he O
has O
been O
very O
good O
on. O
Discussed O
starting O
metformin O
based O
on O
recent O

that O
this O
may O
help O
prevent O
his O
development O
of O

We O
will O
check O
his O

and O
his O
bruising O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
his O

RECOMMENDATIONS: O
I O
discussed O

dosing O
to O
2 O
tablets O
taken O
by O
mouth O
every O
6 O
hours, O
as O
needed O
for O
pain O
control. O
She O
will O
withhold O
a O
Tylenol O
dose, O
when O
she O
takes O
Darvocet O
N-100. O
She O
will O
continue O
taking O
her O
other O
medications O
at O
their O
present O
doses. O
Laboratory O
studies O
will O
be O
performed O
today O
to O
assess O
her O
CBC, O
WBC O
differential O
count, O
plasma O
creatinine, O
ALT, O
AST, O

ESR, O
and O

will O
return O
to O
see O
me O
on O
December O
11, O
2109, O
at O
9:40 O

so O
that O
I O
may O

Dear B-SMOKER
Nurse O
Rivas, O
We O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Ruath O
Doss O
(MRN O
49535763) O
back O
in O
Neurology O
Clinic O
today O
for O
stroke O
and O
subsequent O
seizures. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
myself O
and O
Dr. O
Franklin O
Feliciano. O
Ruath O
Doss O
is O
a O
58yo O
RHF O
with O
a O
history O
of O
poorly O
controlled O
DM, B-DIABETES
htn, B-HYPERTENSION
and O
hypercholesterolemia B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
who O
is O
followed O
here O
in O
Neurology O
clinic O
for O
multiple O
small O
L O
frontoparietal O
strokes O
complicated O
by O
seizures. O
She O
was O
last O
seen O
here O
March O
4th, O
at O
which O
time O
she O
was O
having O
difficulty O
tasting O
food. O
This O
finding O
was O
not O
replicated O
on O
clinical O
exam, O
and O
her O
exam O
was O
otherwise O
unremarkable; O
it O
was O
theorized O
that O
her O
symptoms O
may O
have O
been O
due O
to O
a O
drastic O
alteration O
in O
her O
diet. O
Less O
likely O
possibilities O
included O
a O
viral O
illness O
and O
side O
effect O
of O
hydrochlorthiazide. B-MEDICATION
Otherwise, O
she O
had O
recovered O
well O
from O
her O
strokes, O
and O
had O
not O
had O
additional O
seizures. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
continues O
to O
do O
well. O
She O
reports O
that O
her O
taste O
came O
back O
eventually; O
she O
did O
stop O
the O
hydrochlorthiazide O
under O
your O
direction, O
but O
is O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
taste. O
She O
continues O
to O
eat O
healthfully, O
and O
in O
fact O
has O
lost O
30 O
lbs O
since O
her O
hospitalization. O
Via O
your O
office, O
she O
has O
completed O
a O
cardiac O
stress O
test O
as O
recommended O
after O
suffering O
a O
NSTEMI B-CAD
during I-CAD
her I-CAD
last I-CAD
hospitalization. I-CAD
She O
has O
had O
an O
abdominal O
ultrasound O
which O
may O
have O
shown O
a O
gallstone, O
although O
she O
is O
unsure O
of O
the O
exact O
results. O
Finally, O
she O
informs O
me O
that O
an O
appointment O
with O
Dr. O
Yuhas O
of O
Neurosurgery O
has O
been O
scheduled O
for O
August O
in O
order O
to O
follow O
up O
an O
incidental O
small O
L O
A2 O
aneurysm. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
continues O
to O
take O
Plavix B-MEDICATION
for O
secondary O
stroke O
prevention O
(she O
has O
G6PD O
deficiency). O
Her O
dentist O
would O
like O
to O
take O
her O
off O
this O
medication O
for O
a O
week O
before O
an O
extensive O
outpatient O
procedure O
which O
would O
include O
deep O
root O
cleaning. O
However, O
she O
is O
nervous O
about O
the O
risk O
of O
another O
stroke. O
She O
continues O
to O
tolerate O
her O
Dilantin O
well; O
there O
had O
been O
a O
question O
in O
April O
about O
a O
low O
level, O
but O
the O
test O
had O
been O
inadvertently O
performed O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
a O
held O
dose, O
and O
on O
repeat O
testing O
was O
within O
goal O
at O
12.6. O
She O
denies O
any O
seizure-like O
activity: O
no O
staring O
or O
shaking O
spells, O
or O
episodes O
of O
incontinence O
or O
tongue O
biting. O
She O
reminds O
me O
that O
her O
6 O
month O
anniversary O
of O
seizure O
free O
activity O
is O
approaching, O
and O
thus O
is O
hoping O
that O
she O
might O
be O
able O
to O
resume O
driving. O
She O
denies O
changes O
in O
vision, O
focal O
weakness O
or O
numbness, O
difficulty O
with O
language O
comprehension O
or O
production. O
She O
does O
have O
occasional O
mild O
headaches O
exacerbated O
by O
the O
summer O
heat. O
She O
sometimes O
feels O
as O
though O
she O
has O
'creepy O
crawly O
things O
in O
my O
head,' O
a O
sensation O
similar O
to O
when O
she O
had O
a O
Mohs O
procedure. O

returns O
to O
Neurology O
clinic O
for O
stroke O
complicated O
by O
seizures. O
She O
is O
overall O
doing O
very O
well, O
and O
has O
been O
very O
meticulous O
with O
her O
healthcare O
after O
her O
hospitalizations O
in O
December. O
We O
discussed O
the O
very O
small O
risk O
of O
stroke O
if O
Plavix O
is O
held O
for O
a O
dental O
procedure. O
The O
daily O
risk O
of O
stroke O
is O
so O
small, O
and O
the O
benefit O
of O
proper O
mouth O
care O
so O
great, O
that O
we O
would O
agree O
with O
holding O
clopidogrel. O
If O
she O
does O
not O
want O
to O
stop O
antiplatelet O
medication O
before O
the O
procedure, O
the O
only O
alternative O
would O
be O
a O
heparin O
or O
Lovenox O
bridge. O
However, O
such O
a O
measure O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
extreme, O
especially O
as O
her O
overwhelming O
stroke O
risk O
factors O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
CVA O
were O
her O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
and O
hypercholesterolemia, O
all O
of O
which O
she O
has O
taken O
significant O
strides O
to O
better O
control. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
was O
still O
nervous O
about O
suspending O
the O
Plavix; O
ultimately, O
she O
will O
decide O
on O
the O
optimal O
course O
of O
action. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
will O
have O
repeat O
cholesterol O
panel O
tested O
at O
your O
office O
to O
assess O
her O
response O
to O
the O
increased O
dose O
Lipitor O
and O
dietary O
changes. O
Her O
lipoprotein(a) O
level O
was O
high O
at O
89 O
at O
the O
time O
of O
her O
hospitalization, O
and O
we O
will O
repeat O
this O
lab O
today O
to O
ascertain O
whether O
it O
has O
remained O
elevated. O
I O
have O
also O
written O
her O
a O
letter O
certifying O
that, O
as O
of O
July O
3rd, O
she O
will O
have O
been O
seizure O
free O
for O
6 O
months O
time O
on O
a O
stable O
dose O
of O
Dilantin. O
She O
emphasizes O
that O
she O
would O
call O
my O
office O
or O
go O
to O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
immediately O
if O
there O
she O
were O
to O
have O
any O
seizure-like O
episodes. O
If O
she O
remains O
event O
free O
for O
two O
years, O
we O
may O
consider O
discontinuing O
her O
antiepileptic O
medication. O
Although O
the O
incidentally O
noted O
L O
A2 O
aneurysm O
is O
reassuringly O
stable O
on O
CTA, O
I O
have O
asked O
her O
to O
confirm O
her O
follow O
up O
appointment O
with O
Neurosurgery, O
as O
I O
do O
not O
see O
the O
date O
noted O
in O
the O
computer. O
Finally, O
we O
will O
obtain O
a O
repeat O
carotid O
ultrasound O
this O
fall O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
irregular O
R O
ICA O
plaque O
has O
not O
progressed. O
Of O
note, O
Dr. O
Franklin O
Feliciano O
was O
present O
for O
all O
of O
the O
salient O
aspects O
of O
the O
history O
and O
physical O
exam. O
Together, O
we O
discussed O
with O
the O
patient O
the O
work-up O
and O
treatment O
plan. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
us O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
your O
patient. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
clinic O
in O
4-6 O
months O
time. O

Dear O
Mr. O
Louis, O
It O
was O
very O
nice O
to O
see O
you O
again O
the O
other O
day. O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
doing O
well. O
I O
am O
writing O
to O
let O
you O
know O
about O
your O
recent O
test O
results. O
The O
following O
tests O
were O
essentially O
negative, O
normal, O
or O
unchanged O
from O
prior O
testing O
and O
do O
not O
require O
follow-up O
at O
this O
time. O
1) O
Kidney O
test. O
2) O
Cholesterol. O
Your O
cholesterol O
results O
are O
as O
follows: O
Total O
Cholesterol O
= O
129, O
HDL O
(the O
'good' O
cholesterol) O
= O
43, O
LDL O
(the O
'bad' O
cholesterol) O
= O
70, O
triglycerides O
= O
82. O
My O
records O
indicate O
that O
your O
total O
cholesterol O
has O
increased O
since O
01/11/2072. O
Given O
your O
medical O
history, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
your O
LDL O
(the O
'bad' O
cholesterol) O
below O
100. O
Please O
continue O
to O
follow O
a O
heart-healthy O
diet. O
3) O
Hemoglobin O
A1c. O
This O
is O
a O
blood O
test O
that O
indicates O
how O
well O
you O
have O
controlled O
your O
blood O
sugar O
over O
the O
past O
3 O
months. O
For O
patients O
with O
diabetes, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
it O
below O
7. O
Your O
Hemoglobin O
A1c O
value O
was O
6.5 O
on O
04/04/2073. O
It O
has O
remained O
stable O
compared O
to O
the O
last O
value O
of O
6.5 O
on O
07/12/2072. O
Please O
continue O
to O
check O
your O
sugars O
regularly O
and O
take O
Metformin B-MEDICATION
as O
prescribed. O
4) O
X-ray. O
No O
fractures O
were O
detected O
on O
the O
X-ray O
of O
your O
spine, O
but O
it O
did O
show O
changes O
consistent O
with O
osteoarthritis. O
The O
following O
tests O
were O
abnormal O
or O
require O
follow-up. O
1) O
PSA. O
As O
we O
discussed O
during O
our O
visit, O
this O
is O
a O
blood O
test O
that O
measures O
activity O
in O
your O
prostate, O
and O
is O
one O
way O
to O
measure O
your O
potential O
risk O
of O
prostate O
cancer. O
This O
is O
not O
a O
perfect O
test, O
and O
its O
use O
for O
prostate O
cancer O
screening O
is O
controversial. O
My O
records O
indicate O
that O
your O
PSA O
has O
mildly O
increased O
since O
4/01/72. O
I O
recommend O
that O
you O
follow-up O
with O
a O
urologist O
for O
a O
prostate O
biopsy, O
which O
we O
can O
arrange O
when O
you O
return O
for O
your O
follow-up O
appointment. O
At O
that O
time, O
we O
will O
again O
discuss O
the O
specifics O
of O
the O
PSA O
test O
and O
the O
risks/benefits O
of O
different O
treatment/follow-up O
options. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
questions, O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
reach O
me O
at O
my O
office O
at O
191-537-1871. O
I O
will O
see O
you O
on O
5/16/73 O
at O
9:40am O
for O
our O
next O
appointment. O

REASON O
FOR O
VISIT: O
Mr. O
Nielson O
is O
a O
77-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
Stage O
IIIB O
diffuse O
large O
B O
cell O
non-Hodgkin O
s O
lymphoma O
who O
is O
status O
post O
four O
cycles O
of O
CHOP-R O
chemotherapy O
with O
persistent O
disease O
(documented O
by O
PET O
and O
biopsy). O
He O
underwent O
salvage O
with O
two O
cycles O
of O
R-ICE O
and O
unfortunately O
continued O
to O
have O
PET O
avidity O
in O
the O
area. O
As O
a O
result, O
we O
scheduled O
him O
to O
begin O
therapy O
with O
Zevalin O
next O
Monday. O
He O
is O
here O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
physical O
and O
count O
check O
to O
make O
sure O
he O
has O
adequate O
platelets O
for O
this O
immunotherapy. O
INTERVAL O
HISTORY: O
He O
describes O
an O
episode O
approximately O
one O
week O
ago O
of O
sudden O
onset O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
tightness O
in O
his O
chest. O
He O
sat O
down O
for O
approximately O
10 O
minutes, O
it O
resolved, O
and O
has O
not O
recurred O
since O
then. O
However, O
we O
also O
have O
the O
reports O
of O
a O
follow O
up O
PET/CT O
scan O
which O
was O
performed O
yesterday O
which O
show O
a O
new O
accumulation O
of O
bilateral O
pleural O
effusions O
which O
the O
radiologist O
feels O
are O
most O
consistent O
with O
heart O
failure. O
In O
addition, O
the O
scans O
also O
showe O
the O
prior O
area O
of O
PET O
avidity O
in O
the O
leg O
continues, O
although O
less O
avid. O
This O
area O
is O
in O
the O
medial O
compartment O
of O
the O
left O
thigh O
within O
the O
adductor O
muscles. O
Mr. O
Nielson O
is O
not O
excited O
about O
this. O
In O
addition, O
we O
also O
have O
results O
from O
laboratories O
today O
which O
show O
his O
platelets O
at O
88,000, O
so O
he O
is O
not O
eligible O

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: O
Given O
his O
current O
status, O
we O
have O
decided O
to O
transfer O
him O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
today O
for O
further O
evaluation O
of O
his O
cardiac O
symptoms, O
particularly O
to O
rule O
out O
myocardial O
infarction O
and O
assess O
whether O
he O
is, O
indeed, O
in O
new O
heart O
failure O
We O
attempted O
to O
contact O
cardiology O
for O
an O
outpatient O
evaluation, O
but O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
do O
so.Therefore, O
he O
will O
be O
transported O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
for O
an O
emergent O
workup O
of O
his O
new O
symptoms. O
I O
suspect O
he O
will O
be O
admitted. O
Hopefully, O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get O
his O
cardiac O
issues O
under O
control. O
Unfortunately, O
from O
an O
oncologic O
point O
of O
view, O
it O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
his O
platelet O
count O
will O
reach O
at O
least O
100,000 O
in O
order O
to O
give O
this O
man O
therapy. O
As O
a O
potential O
other O
therapy, O
we O
will O
discuss O
the O
ability O
of O
radiation O
oncology O
to O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
cGy O
to O
that O
local O
area O
considering O
he O
only O
received O
30 O
at O
the O
onset. O

Mr O

is O
a O

yo O
gentleman O
one O
week O
out O
from O
attempted O
placement O
of O
right O
subclavian O
pacemaker- O
complicated O
by O
brief O
arterial O
puncture, O
prompt O
removal O
of O
the O
arterial O
catheter O
and O
successful O
compression. O
Duplex O
ultrasonography O
after O
compression O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
pseudoaneurysm. O
A O
CTA O
done O
yesterday O
to O
evaluate O
his O
thyroid O
was O
read O
as: O
' O
Hematoma O
around O
right O
subclavian O
artery. O
Narrowing O
of O
the O
artery. O
Apparent O
filling O
defect, O
most O
likely O
artifactual. O
If O
thrombus O
is O
of O
clinical O
concern, O
upper O
extremity O
ultrasound O
may O
be O
obtained.' O
On O
physical O
examination, O
he O
has O
mild O
non O
expansile O
hematoma O
of O
the O
right O
chest O
wall. O
His O
right O
hand O
is O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused, O
with O
1+ O
radial O
and O
brachial O
pulses. O
There O
are O
no O
thrills O
or O
bruits. O
My O
review O
of O
arterial O
components O
of O
the O
CT O
show O
the O
following: O
1). O
Hematoma- O
to O
be O
expected O
2). O
Diffuse O
arterial O
calcifications- O
obscures O
the O
ability O
to O
read O
what O
is O
or O
is O
not O
in O
the O
lumen. O
3). O
Venous O
contrast O
bolus O
delivered O
on O
the O
right O
side- O
obscures O
our O
ability O
to O
discern O
the O
anatomy O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
subclavian O
artery. O
4). O
Contrast O
bolus O
inadequate O
to O
comment O
on O
arterial O
anatomy. O
Based O
on O
his O
clinical O
exam, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
on O
an O
anticoagulant, O
a O
follow O
up O
subclavian O
artery O
ultrasound O
examination O
is O
in O
order. O
This O
test O
should O
be O
geared O
towards O
determining O
whether O
there O
is O
any O
evidence O
of O
a O
pseudoaneurysm. O
If O
there O
is O
an O
intraarterial O
filling O
defect, O
I O
would O
not O
pursue O
it. O
He O
is O
anticoagulated O
and O
his O
arm O
is O
viable. O
There O
are O
no O
stigmata O
of O
atheroemboli. O

several O

Exam O
notable O
for O
poor O

some O
confusion O
about O

Labs O
are O
unremarkable O
except O
minor O
electrolyte O

Head O
CT O
unremarkable. O
Her O
prior O
presentation O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
neurosyphillis O
as O
detailed O
above, O
though O
there O
was O
still O
the O
possibility O
of O
neurosarcoid. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
a O
repeat O
LP O
to O
assess O
for O
resolution O
of O
prior O
abnormalities, O
and O
now O
that O
she O
has O
a O
recurrence O
of O
symptoms, O
she O
should O
have O
repeat O
LP. O
She O
should O
also O
have O
an O
MRI O
as O
a O
thalamic O
or O
frontal O
stroke O
is O
another O
possible O
etiology. O
This O
could O
be O
a O
more O
global O
failure O
to O
thrive O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
deconditioning O
followed O
by O
poor O
PO's, O
but O
this O
should O
be O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
exclusion. O
CXR O
raises O
a O
question O
of O
retrocardiac O
opacity O
suggesting O
possible O
PNA, O
but O
with O
normal O

no O
URI O

and O
no O

I O
think O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O

follow O
clinically. O

his O
coronary B-CAD

disease, I-CAD
he O
had O
been O
doing O
somewhat O
better O
until O
he O
underwent O
surgery O
for O
a O
carotid O
artery O
stenosis. O
Since O
that O
surgery O
several O
months O
ago, O
he O
has O
had O
a O
prolonged O
period O
of O
time O
during O
which O
he O
has O
required O
supplemental O
oxygen. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
patient O
is O
being O
treated O
for O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
in O
fact, O
has O
had O
a O
recent O
increase O
in O
his O
dose O
of O
standing O
Lasix. O
The O
patient O
relates O
that O
during O
his O
hospitalization, O
he O
did O
have O
what O
sounds O
like O
a O
pleural O
effusion, O
which O
a O
physician O
did O
try O
to O
drain, O
however, O
unsuccessfully. O
At O
the O
current O
time, O
Mr. O
Joshi O
is O
feeling O
slowly O
better O
and O
feels O
as O
though O
he O
is O
able O
to O
take O
a O
deep O
breath, O
which O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
do O
several O
months O
ago. O
In O
fact, O
he O
was O
told O
recently O
that O
he O
does O
not O
need O
supplemental O
oxygen. O
He O
denies O
a O
chronic O
cough, O
although O
he O
does O
occasionally O
have O
some O
difficulty O
swallowing O
which O
leads O
to O
coughing. O
His O
past O
medical O
history O
includes O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
carotid O
artery O
stenosis, O
coronary O

disease O
with O
both O
angioplasty O

He B-SMOKER
discontinued I-SMOKER

smoking I-SMOKER
years I-SMOKER
ago. I-SMOKER
On O
exam O
today, O
he O
had O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
122/60. O
His O
pulse O
was O
56, O
afebrile. O
O2 O
sat O
on O
room O
air O
initially O
was O
at O
90%, O
but O
when O
I O
rechecked O
it, O
it O
was O
95%. O
His O
weight O
was O
221 O
lbs. O
He O
is O
in O
no O
respiratory O
distress O
at O
rest. O
His O
oropharynx O
had O
dry O
mucosa O
and O
a O
somewhat O
small O
posterior O
pharyngeal O
air O
space. O
His O
neck O
had O
no O
enlarged O
lymph O
nodes. O
Chest O
had O
diminished O
breath O
sounds O
in O
the O
left O
base O
with O
crackles. O
His O
right O
lung O
was O
clear. O
His O
heart O
was O
in O
a O
regular O
bradycardic O
rhythm O
with O
a O
II/III O
systolic O
murmur. O
His O
abdomen O
was O
protuberant, O
but O
benign. O
His O
extremities O
are O
with O
1+ O
pitting O
edema O
and O
no O
clubbing. O
Pulmonary O
function O
testing O
had O
been O
performed O
in O
December O
and O
was O
repeated O
again O
today, O
which O
demonstrates O
that O
he O
has O
a O
combined O
restrictive O
and O
obstructive O
ventilatory O
defect. O
His O
current O
vital O
capacity O
was O
improved O
approximately O
10% O
from O
that O
of O
December. O
He O
has O
no O
bronchodilator O
response. O
I O
took O
Mr. O
Joshi O
for O
a O
short O
walk O
and O
he O
never O
desaturated O
below O
92% O
and O
that O
includes O
after O
walking O
up O
one O
flight O
of O
stairs. O
In O
summary, O
I O
believe O
that O
Mr. O
Joshi O
has O
dyspnea O
which O
is O
likely O
mostly O
related O
to O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
deconditioning. O
However, O
I O
do O
believe O
he O
might O
have O
a O
pleural O
effusion O
based O
on O
my O
exam O
and O
based O
on O
his O
history O
and O
therefore, O
I O
have O
referred O
him O
to O
have O
a O
decubitus O
chest O
film O
taken. O
Mr. O
Joshi O
had O
several O
questions O
related O
to O
his O
metered O
dose O
inhaler O
use O
and O
I O
have O
recommended O
that O
he O
use O
only O
Combivent O
4x O
a O
day O
regularly. O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
there O
is O
any O
benefit O
to O
be O
gained O
from O
an O
inhaled O
corticosteroid O
for O
this O
gentleman. O
I O
do O
recommend O
that O
he O
get O
daily O
exercise. O
He O
certainly O
needs O
to O
continue O
his O
diuresis O
and O
I O
will O
certainly O
check O
his O
chest O
x-ray O
on O
the O
outside O
chance O
that O
he O
may O
benefit O
from O
a O
pleural O
effusion. O
I O
have O
also O
confirmed O
to O
him O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
requires O
supplemental O
oxygen. O
His O
pulmonary O
function O
testing O
also O
had O
demonstrated O
a O
reduced O
defusion O
capacity, O
however, O
it O
does O
correct O
when O
accounting O
for O
albuterol O
volume O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
either O
an O
interstitial O
lung O
disease O
or O
pulmonary O

IMPRESSION: O
The O
patient O
is O
seen O
and O
examined O
with O
Dr. O
Santiago. O
At O
this O
time, O
we O
feel O
that O
Larry O
has O
indeed O
a O
significant, O
right O
worse O
than O
left, O
bilateral O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome. O
Given O
the O
amount O
of O
weakness O
and O
thenar O
wasting, O
he O
has O
difficulty O
with O
abductor O
pollicis, O
we O
have O
recommended O
proceeding O
with O
both O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
as O
well O
as O
possible O
FTS O
of O
ring O

to O

We O
discussed O
with O
Larry O
the O
risks O
and O
benefits O
of O
this O
procedure O
and O
he O
is O
in O
agreement O
of O
the O
plan. O
We O
will O
try O
to O
schedule O
him O
to O
proceed O
with O
surgery O
at O
some O
point O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
We O
filled O

and O

HPI: O
Kadeem O
Vicente O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
a O
follow-up O
office O
visit. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
me O
approximately O
one O
month O
ago O
as O
a O
new O
patient O
and O
whose O
primary O
medical O
concerns O
a O
history B-CAD
of I-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
for O
which O
he O
suffered O
a O
'silent B-CAD
heart I-CAD
attack' I-CAD
many I-CAD
years I-CAD
ago, I-CAD
a O
history O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
as O
well O
as O
hypertension B-HYPERTENSION
and O
GERD. O
As O
it O
turns O
out, O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
on O
Zantac O
for O
many, O
many O
years, O
the O
beneficial O
effects O
of O
which O
were O
unknown. O
We O
had O
decided O
as O
of O
our O
last O
meeting O
to O
stop O
this O
drug O
and O
find O
out O
if O
he O
became O
symptomatic. O
The O
patient O
reports O
today O
that O
he O
is O
not O
symptomatic, O
and O
thus O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
discontinue O
this O
medicine. O
At O
this O
point, O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
need O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
proton O
pump O
inhibitor, O
such O
as O
Prilosec. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
patient's O
symptoms O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
the O
patient O
said O
that O
he O
only O
has O
taken O
one O
dose O
of O
the O
Hytrin, O
since O
he O
wanted O
to O
use O
up O
all O
his O
Minipress, O
which O
he O
tool O
up O
until O
2 O
nights O
ago. O
Thus O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
assess O
the O
efficacy O
of O
this O
medication. O
It O
is O
noted O
that O
his O
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
152/74, B-HYPERTENSION
which O
is O
better O
than O
it O
was O
the O
last B-HYPERTENSION
time I-HYPERTENSION
he I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
here, I-HYPERTENSION
which I-HYPERTENSION
the I-HYPERTENSION
systolic I-HYPERTENSION
range I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
160-170 B-HYPERTENSION
and I-HYPERTENSION
diastolic I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
80-90. I-HYPERTENSION
The O
patient O
reports O
no O
new O
symptomatology O
other O
than O
occasional O
fatigue, O
from O
which O
he O
will O
have O
to O
rest. O
The O
patient O
has O
no O
symptoms O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure, O
no O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
no O
ankle O
edema, O
no O
JVD O
by O
observation, O
and O
his O
laboratory O
results O
are O
remarkably O
normal, O
given O
his O
medical O
complaints. O
The O
patient's O
cholesterol O
is O
190 O
with O
a O
slightly O
above O
average O
triglycerides. O
Review O
of O
systems O
otherwise O
negative. O

was O

and O

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: O
This O
is O
a O
75 O
year O
old O
man O
with O
multiple O
medical O
problems O
coming O
in O
for O
follow-up. O
1. O
Hypertension O
- O
the O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
Zestril B-MEDICATION
and O
will O
use O
Hytrin O
now, O
both O
for O
his O
hypertension, O
as O
well O
as O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy. O
The O
patient O
does O
speak O
of O
some O
nocturnal O
dribbling, O
and O
he O
said O
he O
also O
has O
urge O
incontinence, O
particularly O
while O
standing. O
The O
patient O
was O
told O
that O
after O
a O
trial O
of O
Hytrin, O
which O
hopefully O
can O
help O
with O
his O
symptoms O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
that O
this O
urge O
incontinency O
will O
also O
be O
helped. O
If O
the O
patient's O
symptoms O
continue O
beyond O
this, O
he O
will O
be O
referred O
to O
Urology O
for O
possible O
TUNA O
procedure. O
2. O

- O
please O
see O
above. O
The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
Hytrin O
for O
now. O

the O
patient's O
cholesterol O
is O

with O
a O
slightly O
above O

which O
is O
more O
than O
acceptable O
for O
this O
gentleman. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
an O
HDL O
in O
which O
to O
judge O
his O
ratio, O

I O
was O

the O
patient O
before O

Ms. O
Yerger's O
postoperative O

was O
notable O
for O
persistent O

Overall, O
these O

Ms. O

looks O
extremely O
well O
today. O
She O
is O
comfortable O
seated O
on O
the O

Her O
skin O

She O
has O

She O
has O
no O

Her O
carotids O
are O
2+ O
without O

Her O
chest O
reveals O
decreased O
breath O
sounds O
at O
the O
left O
base. O
There O
are O
no O
crackles O
or O

Cardiac O
exam O

There O
was O
a O

continues O
on O

her O
non-ST B-CAD
elevation I-CAD

and I-CAD
coronary I-CAD

grafting I-CAD
in O
mid O
October. O
Her O
persistent O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
may O
be O
related O
to O
persistent O
pleural O
effusion. O
We O
will O
reevaluate O
today O
with O
a O
repeat O
chest O
x-ray. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
think O
that O
we O
should O
continue O
her O
oral O
diuretic O
regimen. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
persistent O
rash O
is O
related O
to O
her O
Lasix. O
Although O
not O
certain O
to O
be O
successful, O
we O
have O
made O
a O
change O
to O
Bumex O
1 O
mg O
po O
q. O
day O
today O
in O
the O
hopes O
that O
if O
Lasix O
is O
responsible O
for O
her O
rash O
this O
may O
resolve. O
I O
have O
made O
no O
other O
changes O
to O
her O
medical O
regimen. O
We O
will O
continue O
aspirin, O
beta O
blockade, O
ACE O
inhibition O
and O
statin O
for O
secondary O
prevention. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
seeing O
her O
again O
in O
approximately O
eight O
to O
twelve O
weeks. O
In O
addition, O
she O
will O
follow- O
up O
with O
Dr. O
Abreu O
for O
possible O
thoracentesis O
if O
she O
has O
a O
persistent O
pleural O

that O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
her O

year O
old O

who O
presents O
for O
an O
annual O
exam O
with O
her O
daughter-in-law, O
Franchesca O
Justice. O
They O
would O
like O
to O
discuss O
the O
following O
issues: O
1. O
Shoulder O
pain: O
She O
continues O
to O
have O
bilateral O
shoulder O
pain, O
but O
the O
L O
shoulder O
is O
worse O
than O
the O
right. O
She O
has O
been O
taking O
Prednisone O
9 O
mg O
a O
day O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
has O
not O
f/u O
with O
Rheum O
for O
about O
a O
year. O
She O
did O
have O
a O
cortisone O
in O
the O
L O
shoulder O
in O
the O
past. O
She O
is O
able O
to O
lift O
her O
arms O
over O
her O
head. O
2. O
Depression: O
Her O
family O
feels O
that O
she O
is O
doing O
much O
better O
on O
the O
Effexor O
than O
the O
Celexa. O
The O
pt O
has O
seen O
Dr. O
Ramsey O
in O
Psych O
a O
few O
months O
ago. O
3. O
Dementia: O
Dr. O
Ramsey O
recommended O
continuing O
on O
the O
Aricept. O
Overall, O
the O
pt's O
family O
feels O
that O
her O
memory O
is O
worsening, O
although O
some O
days O
are O
better O
than O
others. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
any O
other O
episodes O
of O
halluncination, O
as O
was O
described O
in O
an O
email O
from O
her O
son O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago. O
The O
pt O
states O
that O
she O
is O
sleeping O
and O
eating O
well, O
but O
her O
family O
thinks O
that O
she O
sleeps O
too O
much. O
4. O
Eyelid O
surgery: O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
have O
surgery O
on O
her O
eyelids O
on O
May O
25. O
The O
drooping O
of O
the O
lids O
is O
so O
bad O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
that O
she O
is O
unable O
to O
read. O
5. O
Incontinence: O
She O
has O
now O
had O
3 O
collagen O
implants O
for O
her O
bladder. O
The O
pt O
does O
not O
think O
that O
she O
is O
any O
better, O
but O
when O
Dr. O
Xuereb O
tested O
her O
a O
few O
months O
ago, O
she O
saw O
some O
improvement. O
6. O
Diarrhea: O
She O
has O
about O
2 O
soft O
BM's O
a O
day, O
but O
she O
also O
has O
intermittent O
diarrhea. O
Her O
daughter-in-law O
is O
wondering O
if O
the O
pt O
might O
be O
lactose O
intolerant. O
She O
is O
not O
having O
any O
blood O
in O
her O
stool. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
any O
diarrhea O
in O
the O

of O
the O

that O
she O

1. O
PMR: O
Discussed O
the O
importance O
of O
regular O
f/u O
with O
Dr. O
Inge. O
We O
should O
aim O
to O
get O
the O
dose O
of O
Prednisone O
decreased. O
Will O
check O
ESR O
today. O
Franchesca O
will O
make O
sure O

with O
Dr. O

2. O
Depression: O
She O
seems O
better. O
Continue O
Effexor. O
3. O
Dementia: O
Will O
continue O
Aricept. O
Discussed O
keeping O
pt O
stimulated O
with O
outings, O
family O
visits. O
Her O
excessive O
sleeping O
is O
likely O
a O
combination O
of O
several O
factors, O
including O
her O
multiple O
medications, O
depression, O
and O
possibly O
the O
dementia. O
4. O
Eyelid O
surgery: O
Pre-op O
exam O
today. O
Will O
order O
complete O
metabolic O
panel, O
CBC, O
and O
EKG. O
5. O
Incontinence: O
It O
is O
not O
likely O
that O
she O
will O
be O
able O
to O
have O
any O
more O
procedures O
at O
this O
point. O
Some O
of O
the O
incontinence O
may O
be O
secondary O
to O
dementia O
rather O
than O
pure O
stress O
incontinence. O
6. O
Diarrhea: O
Discussed O
trying O
a O
lactose-free O
diet O
for O
a O
week O
to O
determine O
if O
lactose-intolerance O
may O
be O
playing O
a O
role. O
Will O
set O
up O
a O
virtual O
colonoscopy O
since O
the O
pt O
had O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
with O
the O
sedation O
for O
her O
colonoscopy O
2 O
years O
ago. O
7. O
DM: O
Check O
glucose O
and O
Hgb O
A1C. O
8. O
Hyperlipidemia: O
Check O
fasting O
lipids- O
she O
will O
get O
them O
drawn O
at O
Dameron O
Hospital. O
9. O
Medication O
compliance: O
Discussed O
trying O
to O
get O
nurse O
to O
come O
a O
little O
later O
in O
the O
day O
so O
that O
pt O
could O
be O
observed O
while O
taking O
her O
medication. O
10. O
Onychomycosis: O
I O
do O
not O
think O
oral O
medication O
would O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
for O
this O
patient O
because O
the O
risks O
of O
hepatotoxicity O
outweigh O
the O
benefits. O
Will O
refer O
her O
to O
Podiatry O
for O
care O
of O
the O
toenails O
since O
the O
pt O
has O
a O
h/o O
peripheral O

We O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O
Cora O
Quinley O
in O
followup O
today O
in O
the O
Cardiology O

As O

woman O
with O

(EF O

as O
well O
as O
paroxysmal O

She O
last O
saw O
me O
in O
clinic O
in O
03/2077, O
and O
missed O
several O
followup O
appointments O
in O
part O
because O
she O
spends O
much O
of O
her O
time O
in O
Oregon. O
Over O
the O
past O
year O
and O
several O
months, O
Ms. O
Quinley O
has O
been O
doing O
quite O
well. O
She O
states O
that O
she O
has O
episodes O
of O
palpitations O
approximately O
every O
2 O
months, O
lasting O
less O
then O
5 O
minutes. O
She O
notes O
a O
sensation O
of O
fluttering O
in O
her O
chest, O
with O
no O
chest O
tightness, O
no O
dyspnea, O
no O
lightheadedness, O
no O
syncope. O
She O
denies O
PND, O
orthopnea, O
or O
angina. O
Unfortunately, O
Ms. O
Quinley O
continues O
to O
smoke, O
but O
is O
actively O
interested O
in O
quitting. O
She O
states O
that O
she O
is O
planning O
to O
enroll O
in O
the O
Stonybrook O
Smoking O

she O

today O
in O
no O

Blood O
pressure O
is O

in O
the O

Abdomen O
is O

with O
no O

or O

Pulse O
examination O
is O
normal. O
Recent O
lipid O
profile O
from O
03/2078 O
reveals O
a O
LDL B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
of I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
150. I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA

with O
no O

In O
summary, O
Ms. O
Quinley O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
Her O
palpitations O
and O
likely O
SVT O
are O
occuring O
at O
a O
frequency O
that O
Ms. O
Quinley O
feels O
are O
quite O
acceptable O
for O
her. O
Therefore, O
she O
wishes O
no O
consideration O
of O
possible O
interventions O
or O
changes O
in O
her O
medical O
regimen. O
She O
has O
no O
symptoms O
to O
suggest O
current O
coronary O
ischemia. O
Regarding O
her O
cardiovascular O
risk O
factors, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
reasonably O
well O
controlled O
today, O
and O
you O
are O
actively O
managing O
her O
diabetes. O
However, O
her O
lipid O
profile O
demonstrates O
an O
elevated O
LDL. O
Therefore, O
I O
have O
taken O
liberty O
of O
increasing O
her O
Lipitor O
to O
40 O
mg O
q.h.s. O
I O
plan O
to O
see O
Ms. O
Quinley O
in O
followup O
in O
approximately O
6 O
months. O
Please O
feel O
free O
to O
contact O
me O
otherwise O
regarding O
her O
cardiovascular O
issues. O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
referring O
this O
very O
pleasant O
woman O
for O
cardiovascular O
care. O

significant O
metabolic O

including O
hyponatremia, O

She O
also O
has O

Hyponatremia O
&#8211; O
Calculated O
serum O

euvolemic, O
despite O

which O
may O
be O
from O

A O

notes O
she O
is O
told O

Interestingly O
this O
may O
have O
been O
precipitated O
by O

The O

1. O
GI: O
Pain O
is O
responsive O
to O
morphine. O
Will O
continue O
MS O

and O
treat O
with O
IV O

Gastroparesis O
has O

a O

diagnosis O
since O
all O

has O
been O
negative. O
She O
has O
other O

which O
does O
put O
her O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
autonomic O

Other O
diagnoses O
to O
consider O
are O
bowel O

in O
the O
past O
have O
not O
shown O
any O
changes O
in O
the O
bowel O
consistent O
with O
this O
diagnosis. O
We O
will O
order O
CTA O

rule O
this O
out. O
She O
did O
have O
a O
negative O
anti-endomysial O
Ab O
in O
2081, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
checking O
both O

anti-gliadin O
Ab O
to O

from O
Missouri O
Baptist O
Hospital. O
2. O
HTN: O
BP O
is O
very O
elevated O
today, O
and O
this O
may O
in O
part O
be O
due O
to O
stopping O
the O
clonidine O
(which O
may O
have O
been O
given O
to O

motility). O
Will O

In O

Dear O

I O
had O
the O

Nick O

in O
WSH O
cardiology O
clinic O
today O
in O

of O
his O
recent O

to O

ICMA. O
While O
I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
his O
history, O
please O
allow O
me O
to O
briefly O
review O
it O
for O
my O
records. O
He O
is O
a O
lovely O
53 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
whose O
history O
is O
remarkable O
for O
Hodgkins, O
status O
post O
mantle O
radiation O
in O
the O
early O
70's; O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
status B-CAD
post-PCI B-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
and I-CAD
RCA I-CAD
in O
'90 O
and O
'87, O
respectively, O
and O
recently O
diagnosed O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer. O
MIBI B-CAD
done O
at O
LMC O
1/24/94 O
showed O
normal O
EF O
without O
perfusion O
defects O
(no O
scar O
or O
ischemia); O
he O
exercised O
10:30 O
on O
a O
standard O
Bruce O
iwthout O
symptoms. O
He O
was O
admitted O
2/94 O
for O
elective O
left O
upper O
lobectomy O
for O
his O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer O
(ASA B-MEDICATION
was O
stopped O
1 O
week O
prior O
to O
surgery; O
he O
was O
not O
on O
plavix B-MEDICATION
preop); O
in O
PACU O
following O
resection, O
he O
had O
a O
VT/VF O
arrest O
and O
was O
taken O
emergently O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
lab, O
where O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
massive B-CAD
volume I-CAD
of I-CAD
thrombus I-CAD
extending I-CAD
throughout I-CAD
his I-CAD
RCA. I-CAD
After O
extensive O
suction O
catheter O
use O
and O
POBA, B-CAD
a O
good O
angiographic O
result O
was O
obtained; O
no O
stents O
were O
placed O
due O
to O
the O
heightened O
thrombotic O
state O
that O
he O
was O
in. O
Remarkably, O
echocardiogram O
revealed O
normal O
LV O
systolic O
function, O
with O
basal O
inferoposterior O
HK O
noted. O
His O
peak O
TnI O
was O
33.6, O
his O
peak O
CK O
was O
1710, O
and O
his O
peak O
MB O
was O
87.2. O
He O
had O
a O
relatively O
unremarkable O
course O
post-catheterization; O
plavix O
initiation O
was O
delayed O
until O
his O
chest O
tube O
was O
removed, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
started O
without O
incident. O
He O
was O
discharged O
2/11/94, O
and O
returns O
today O
for O
routine O
follow-up. O
Regarding O
his O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer, O
it O
is O
my O
understanding O
that O
he O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
metastatic O
disease O
and O
that O
margins O
were O
negative; O
he O
is O
not O
currently O
planned O
for O
any O
adjuvant O
therapy, O
but O
will O
be O
closely O
followed. O
Regarding O
his O
remote O
history O
of O
Hodgkins, O
he O
is O
followed O
at O
RFPC, O
and O
is O
due O
for O
an O
annual O
visit O
there O
in O
the O
next O
1-2 O
months. O
He O
has O
been O
walking O
outside O
for O
the O
past O
~2 O
weeks O
(since O
the O
weather O
improved), O
walking O
about O
2 O
miles O
in O
around O
30 O
minutes. O
He O
feels O
well, O
and O
has O
had O
no O
problems. O
He O
notes O
some O
mild O
dyspnea O
with O
increased O
exertion O
(climbing O
hills), O
but O
denies O
any O
unusual O
dyspnea. O
He O
denies O
chest O

old O
man O
who O
had O
a O
VF O
arrest O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
perioperative O
inferior O
STEMI, O
status O
post O
extensive O
angiojet O
and O
POBA O
of O
acute O
in-stent O
thrombosis O
of O
presumed O
bare O
metal O
stents O
in O
his O
RCA. O
He O
is O
asymptomatic O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
standpoint, O
and O
somewhat O
remarkably O
did O
not O
take O
a O
large O
myocardial O
hit O
from O
this O
life-threatening O
event. O
Our O
attention O
now O
shifts O
to O
the O
prevention O
of O
future O
events. O
Given O
the O
degree O
of O
thrombus O
burden O
in O
his O
RCA O
at O
the O
time O
of O
cath, O
he O
is O
someone O
for O
whom O
we O
would O
strongly O
advise O
lifelong O
plavix O
and O
aspirin. O
Furthermore, O
he O
is O
not O
someone O
for O
whom O
I O
would O
be O
comfortable O
with O
even O
temporary O
discontinuation O
of O
one O
of O
these O
agents O
- O
we O
would O
advise O
that O
ANY O
future O
procedures O
be O
done O
on O
aspirin O
and O
plavix. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
are O
well O
controlled O
on O
his O
current O
regimen, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
his O
home O
records. O
I O
have O
taken O
the O
liberty O
today O
of O
changing B-MEDICATION
him I-MEDICATION
from I-MEDICATION
lopressor I-MEDICATION
200 I-MEDICATION
bid I-MEDICATION
to I-MEDICATION
toprol B-MEDICATION
200 O
bid O
to O
minimize O
any O
ups O
and O
downs O
in O
his O
beta O
blockade, O
but O
otherwise, O
would O
not O
make O
any O
changes O
to O
his O
regimen O
at O
this O
time. O
We O
will O
check O
a O
full O
set O
of O
labs O
today, O
but O
I O
suspect O
that O
no O
further O
changes O
will O
be O
required O
at O
this O
time. O
Given O
his O
history O
of O
Hodgkin's, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
known O
CAD, O
he O
is O
clearly O
at O
risk O
for O
future O
events, O
and O
I O
suspect O
that O
we O
will O
take O
a O
rather O
aggressive O
stance O
in O
terms O
of O
monitoring O
for O
ischemia. O
Certainly, O
if O
he O
has O
any O
concerning O
symptoms, O
we O
would O
have O
a O
low O
threshold O
to O
pursue O
an O
aggressive O
course. O
At O
present, O
however, O
I O
am O
delighted O
with O
how O
well O
he O
is O
doing. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Hall O
in O
cardiology O
clinic O
today. O
I O
will O
plan O
to O
see O
him O
in O
follow-up O
in O
6 O
months O
time, O
but O
he O
knows O
to O
call O
sooner O
should O
he O
have O
any O
problems O
or O
concerns. O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
The O
patient O
is O
in O
no O
distress. O
Her O
initial O
blood O
pressure, O
as O
she O
walked O
down O
the O
hall, O
was O
154/71. B-HYPERTENSION
Repeating O
this O
after O
sitting O
was O
126/68. O
Lungs: O
Clear. O
Cardiac: O
Regular. O
Extremities: O
Trace O
edema. O
ASSESSMENT: O
Uncontrolled O
adult O
onset O
diabetes. O
Care O
for O
this O
will O
be O
challenging O
due O
to O
the O
patient's O
cognitive O
problems. O
She O
does O
use O
Valley O
Hospital O
Web O
Services. O
We O
discussed O
to O
start O
frequent O
communication O
via O
Web O
Services O
of O
test O
results O
will O
be O
helpful O
for O
me O
in O
helping O
her O
adjust O
insulin. O
We O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
of O
changing O
from O
NPH O
to O
Lantus B-MEDICATION
insulin, O
but O
elected O
to O
continue O
her O
NPH O
for O
now. O
We O
discussed O
that O
her O
use O
of O
the O
ultra-fast O
acting O
insulin O
does O
not O
quite O
make O
sense. O
She O
is O
taking O
an O
injection O
in O
the O
evening, O
long O
after O
her O
meal. O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
describe O
her O
meals O
and O
she O
has O
carbohydrates O
essentially O
with O
every O
meal. O
I O
think O
initially O
she O
can O
easily O
tolerate O
10 O
units O
of O
Humalog O
with O
each O
meal. O
She O
notes O
that O
she O
prefers O
to O
inject O
the O
insulin O
after O
she O
eats, O
which O
is O
acceptable O
as O
long O
she O
does O
it O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
the O
meal. O
She O
currently O
is O
using O
an O
average O
of O
15 O
units, O
so O
this O
will O
increase O
her O
total O
daily O
insulin O
use O
by O
just O
15 O
units. O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
check O
3 O
fingersticks O
a O
day O
for O
me O
and O
to O
e-mail O
them O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
start. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fasting O
fingerstick. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
before O
her O
evening O
meal, O
which O
is O
her O
largest O
meal O
of O
the O
day. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
2 O
hours O
after O
her O
evening O
meal. O
She O
does O
not O
need O
to O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
right O
before O
bed. O
She O
will O
stop O
using O
Humalog O
right O
before O
bed O
and O
only O
use O
the O
NPH O
at O
that O
time. O
We O
discussed O
the O
importance O
of O
cholesterol O
treatment. O
Her B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
last B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
LDL I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
was I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
over I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
100. I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
I O
would O
like O
to O
revisit O
the O
idea O
of O
using O
a O
statin. O
I O
will O
repeat O
her O
CK O
level O
to O
see O
if O
this O
remains O
elevated. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
on O
recheck O
is O
acceptable. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
the O
office O
in O
2 O
months O
rather O
than O
what O
is O
booked O
now. O
Most O
of O
our O
visit O
today O
took O
place O
together O
with O
her O
husband. O
We O
spent O
a O
total O
of O
25 O
minutes O
with O
more O
than O
half O
the O
time O
spent O
in O
counseling. O

About O
that O
time O
she O
was O
prescribed O
Amoxicillin O

and O
she O
started O
a O

of O
oral O
methylprednisolone. O
She O
stopped O
this O
several O

because O
it O

The O

The O

the O

he O
was O
extubated O
on O
the O
4th. O
HTN O
was O
controlled O
with O
labetolol O

added. O
He O
continued O
to O
have O
intermittent O

and O
was O
on O
broad O

which O
were O
originally O
weaned O
off. O
Hematologically, O
the O

for O
several O
days O
before O
increasing O
on O
the O

gradually O
up O

and O
he O
was O
started O
on O

Initially O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
thrombocytosis O
was O
most O
certainly O
reactive; O
CRP O
was O
&gt;150 O
with O
ESR O
&gt;100. O
He O
left O
the O
ICU O
and O
at O
this O
point O
his O
WBC O
trended O
down O
and O
he O
was O
afebrile O
and O
more O
clinically O
stable. O
But O
his O
platelets O
kept O
climbing O
to O
nearly O
1.5 O
million. O
A O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
was O
done O
showing O
no O
cytogenetics O
to O
suggest O
CML O
and O
there O
were O
elevated O
megakaryocytes O
read O
as O
concerning O
for O
a O
myeloproliferative O
process. O
As O
well, O
he O
suffered O
a O
DVT O
in O
his O
subclavian/IJ O
on O
the O

side O
as O
a O
central O
venous O
catheter. O
Given O
his O
thrombocytosis O
and O
elevated O
plt O

he O
was O
platelet O
pheresed O
twice O
in O
the O

As O
well, O
hydrea O
was O
started O
at O
this O

initially O
at O
500mg O

to O
1000mg O

when O
his O

were O
up O
to O
800-900 O
despite O
the O

As O
well, O
he O
suffered O
a O
small O
GI O
bleed O
due O
to O
an O
ulcer. O
For O
this O
reason O
he O
was O
not O

his O
next O
visit O
with O
us O
next O
month O
we O
will O
recheck O
his O
C-reactive O
protein, O
ESR, O
iron O
studies/ferritin O
for O
some O
idea O
of O
whether O
his O
body O
could O
still O
be O
mounting O
an O
inflammatory O
response O
to O
drive O
a O
reactive O
thrombocytosis. O
If O
his O
plt O
count O
comes O
down, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
start O
tapering O
his O
hydrea O
at O
that O
time. O
Of O
note, O
in O
the O
near O
future, O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
help O
determine O
between O
reactive O
and O
essential O
process O
with O
measurement O
of O
the O
JAK2 O
kinase O
level. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
he O
will O
be O
meeting O
with O
his O
new O
PCP O
and O
renal O
physician O
next O
week. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Peralta: O
I O
saw O
your O
patient, O
Dr. O
Gipson, O
in O
the O
Cardiology O
Office O
today O
on O
a O
somewhat O
urgent O
basis. O
He O
was O
recently O
in O
Italy O
last O
week O
with O
very O
difficult O
events O
concerning O
his O
father's O
ill O
health. O
His O
father O
ultimately O
died O
and O
was O
a O
very O
traumatic O
series O
of O
days O
for O
Dr. O
Gipson O
and O
his O
family. O
He O
developed O
left O
chest O
discomfort, O
which O
persisted O
for O
a O
number O
of O
days. O
He O
was O
afraid O
to O
take O
nitroglycerin O
despite O
knowing O
that O
he O
should, O
and O
therefore O
remained O
with O
chest O
discomfort O
for O
about O
six O
days. O
He O
was O
able O
to O
be O
reasonably O
active O
and O
had O
no O
exacerbation O
of O
his O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
had O
no O
nausea, O
vomiting, O
diaphoresis, O
or O
palpitations. O
He O
then O
returned O
to O
the O
United O
States O
and O
his O
symptoms O
have O
resolved. O
Because O
of O
these O
discomforts, O
he O
wanted O
to O
undergo O
an O
additional O
evaluation. O
We O
performed O
an O
exercise O
treadmill O
test O
with O
perfusion O
imaging O
two O
days O
ago O
for O
better O
understanding O
of O
his O
symptoms. O
He O
exercised O
for O
7 O
minutes O
and O
30 O
seconds O
on O
the O
standard O
Bruce O
protocol O
to O
a O
peak O
heart O
rate O
of O
122 O
beats O
per O
minute O
(84% O
of O
maximum O
predicted O
for O
age) O
and O
peak O
blood O
pressure O
of O
162/80. O
He O
stopped O
because O
of O
dyspnea O
and O
had O
some O
discomfort. O
The O
discomfort O
resolved O
into O
recovery. O
He O
had O
no O
ST O
segment O
changes. O
His O
perfusion O
scan O
demonstrated O
normal O
LV O
size O
and O
normal O
tracer O
uptake O
in O
the O
lungs. O
There O
was O
normal O
RV O
size O
as O
well. O
There O
was O
a O
small-to-medium O
medium-sized O
defect O
of O
moderate O
intensity O
in O
the O
mid O
and O
basal O
inferior O
wall O
that O
was O
reversible. O
These O
were O
no O
different O
than O
the O
prior O
study O
he O
had O
in O
July O
2061. O
As O
you O
may O
remember, O
in O
January O
2061, O
he O
underwent O
cardiac O
catheterization O
that O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
non-major O
flow-limiting O
obstructions O
and O
so O
no O
intervention O
was O
performed. O
His O
current O
medical O

includes O
ramipril B-MEDICATION

On O
exam O
today, O
he O
is O
comfortable O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
135/75, O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
60 O
and O
regular, O
and O
weight O
of O
189 O
pounds. O
Head O
and O
neck O
are O
unremarkable. O
Chest O
is O
clear. O
Cardiac O
exam O
shows O
no O
jugular O
venous O
distention O
at O
30 O
degrees. O
PMI O
is O
normal. O
S1 O
and O
S2 O
are O
normal O
with O
a O
physiologic O
split. O
There O
is O
an O
S4 O
and O
1/6 O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
at O
the O
left O
sternal O
border. O
Abdominal O
exam O
is O
unremarkable O
without O
organomegaly. O
Bowel O
sounds O
are O
normal. O
The O
extremities O
show O
no O
edema O
or O
cyanosis. O
Carotid O
upstrokes O
are O
normal O
in O
contour O
and O
volume O
without O
bruit. O
Distal O
pulses O
are O
normal. O
His O
resting O
12-lead O
electrocardiogram O
demonstrates O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
and O
normal O
morphology. O
I O
think O
Dr. O
Gipson O
is O
basically O
doing O
very O
well. O
I O
think O
his O
chest O
discomforts O
for O
six O
days O
while O
in O
Italy O
may O
be O
related O
to O
anxiety O
and O
perhaps O
the O
known O
gastroesophageal O
reflux O
disease O
that O
he O
has. O
I O
think O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
discomfort O
was O
cardiac O
in O
origin. O
His O
exercise O
capacity O
is O
quite O
good O
and O
his O
perfusion O
is O
actually O
somewhat O
even O
improved O
from O
his O
prior O
evaluation O
two O
years O
ago. O
I O
think O
we O
can O
maintain O
our O
current O
approach. O
I O
suggest O
that O
I O
see O
him O
in O
a O
number O
of O
months O
for O
future O
evaluation. O
If O
any O
problems O
develop O
in O
the O
interim, O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
help O
with O
his O
care. O
Kindest O
regards. O
Sincerely O
yours, O

Stage O
IVB O
(axillary O

mass) O
History: O
Patient O
is O
a O
72 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
began O
having O
dysphagia O
about O
4 O
weeks O
ago. O
On O
8/01/83 O
he O
was O
scheduled O
for O
a O
Colonoscopy, O
so O
his O
PCP O
suggested O
he O
have O
an O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
The O
Colonoscopy O
demonstrated O
Diverticulosis O
and O
the O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
demonstrated O
a O
partially O
obstructing O
esophageal/gastric O
cardia O
tumor O
which O
was O
biopsied. O
Pathology O
revealed O
moderately O
to O
poorly O
differentiated O
adenocarcinoma. O
On O
8/10/83 O
an O
Abd O
and O
Pelvic O
CT O
were O
done O
showing: O
marked O
thickening O
of O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
distal O
esophagus O
(35-40cm O
by O
endoscopy O
- O
partial O
obstruction O
and O
circumferential) O
extending O
into O
the O
gastric O
cardia, O
consistent O
with O
biopsy O
proven O
adenocarcinoma. O
Also O
felt O
to O
be O
bleeding O
silently O
so O
placed O
on O
Fe O
replacement. O
Also, O
enlarged O
gastroepiploic, O
celiac O
and O
aortocaval O
lymph O
nodes O
consistent O
with O
metastatic O
disease. O
On O
8/10/83 O
a O
Chest O
CT O
revealed O
thickening O
of O
the O
lower O
esophagus O
extending O
into O
the O
chest O
esophageal O
junction. O
This O
is O
associated O
with O
lymphadenopathy O
in O
the O
(L) O
axilla, O
gastrohepatic O
ligament, O
celiac O
axis O
and O
retrocrural O
space. O
The O
appearance O
is O
highly O
suspicious O
for O
esophageal O
cancer O
and O

spread. O
There O
is O
a O
3mm O

PET O

The O

was O

72 O
year O
old O
man O
with O
Stage O
IVB O
metastatic O
esophageal O
cancer. O
He O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
Given O
the O
fairly O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
his O
cancer O
we O
have O
opted O
to O
start O
with O
radiation O
first, O
as O
his O
primary O
mass O
is O
fungating O
in O
nature O
and O
there O
has O
been O
evidence O
of O
blood O
loss. O
After O
radiation O
is O
completed O
in O
3-4 O
weeks, O
I O
will O
see O
him O
for O
consideration O
of O
chemotherapy O
but O
only O
after O
re-staging. O
If O
he O
remains O
asymptomatic O
and O
there O
has O
been O
little O
progression O
of O
disease, O
we O
may O
opt O
to O
observe O
him O
closely O
without O
treatment. O
If O
the O
scans O
show O
significant O
progression O
or O
he O
becomes O
symptomatic, O
then O
we O
will O
start O
systemic O
treatment O
soon O
afterwards. O
He O
is O
not O
a O
surgical O
candidate O
given O
his O
stage O
of O
disease O
and O
lack O
of O
symptoms. O
RTC O
in O
5 O
weeks O
to O
assess O
symptoms O
and O
to O
arrange O
restaging O
scans. O

HPI: O
Mr. O
Nielson O
was O
in O
his O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
until O
March O
of O
this O
year O
when O
he O
began O
noticing O
increasing O
swelling O
in O
his O
left O
leg O
over O
a O
period O
of O
three O
weeks. O
He O
also O
developed O
b/l O
groin O
swelling O
greater O
on O
the O
left; O
the O
swelling O
in O
the O
left O
groin O
was O
tender. O
He O
presented O
in O
early O
April O
where O
CT O
and O
PET O
scan O
of O
the O
pelvis O
and O
abdomen O
revealed O
a O
6.0 O
cm O
inguinal O
node, O
a O
chain O
of O
nodes O
in O
the O
retrocrural O
space, O
adenopathy O
in O
the O
external O
iliac O
chain O
(largest O
3.5 O
cm), O
and O
two O
nodes O
in O
the O
retroperitoneal O
space O
in O
between O
the O
IVC O
and O
aorta. O
He O
underwent O
biopsy O
of O
the O
left O
groin O
mass O
two O
weeks O
later O
revealing O
DLBCL O
confimed O
by O
immunophenotyping. O
Subsequent O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
revealed O
polyclonal O
B-cell O
populations O
and O
an O
inverted O
CD4/CD8 O
T O
Cell O
ratio, O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
monoclonal O
proliferation. O
The O
patient O
underwent O
his O
initial O
two O
cycles O
of O
CHOP O
in O
May, O
and O
experienced O
no O
adverse O
effects O
except O
for O
generalized O
weakness. O
PET O
exam O
in O
early O
June O
revealed O
larger O
left O
groin O
mass, O
improvement O
in O
lymphadenopathy, O
and O
a O
small O
pancreatic O
cystic O
lesion. O
It O
was O
undetermined O
whether O
this O
represented O
treatment O
effect O
or O
worsening O
of O
disease. O
The O
patient O
subsequently O
had O
his O
next O
two O
CHOP O
treatments O
in O
mid O
June O
and O
early O
July. O
PET O
scan O
and O
lymph O
node O
biopsy O
in O
early O
July O
revealed O
unchanged O
disease O
with O
evidence O
of O
fibrosis O
and O
inflammation. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
clinic O
by O
Dr. O
Quadri O
twice O
in O
July, O
with O
the O
second O
visit O
revealing O
increased O
PET O
avidity O
and O
persistence O
of O
the O
primary O
mass. O
Given O
the O
persistence O
of O
the O
mass O
and O
lack O
of O
response O
to O
CHOP, O
the O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Rodgers O
of O
the O
WDMC O
one O
week O
later O
on O
7/28 O
for O
consideration O
of O
auto-SCT O
vs O
more O
aggressive O
chemo O
regimen. O
Due O
to O
the O
patient's O
age O
and O
consideration O
of O
risk/benefit, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
best O
approach O
would O
be O
to O
attempt O
a O
more O
aggressive O
chemo O
regimen O
first. O
Mr. O
Nielson O
was O
admitted O
on O
8/2/2097 O
to O
receive O
his O
first O
cycle O
of O
R-ICE O
with O
dose-reduced O
Ifos O
and O
carboplatin O
becuase O
of O
h/o O
nephrectomy. O
He O
tolerated O
the O
treatment O
fairly O
well O
with O
some O
panycytopenia. O
Patient O
felt O
the O
R-ICE O
regimen O
was O
a O
little O
harder O
on O
him O
than O
the O
CHOP O
regimen. O
He O
felt O
effects O
including O
fatigue O
and O
constipation O
that O
resolved O
back O
to O
baseline O
in O
a O
few O
days. O
On O
8/9, O
he O
was O
given O
2 O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
cells O
due O
to O
anemia O
and O
on O
8/16, O
he O
was O
given O
a O
unit O
of O
pheresis O
platelets O
for O
his O
thrombocytopenia O
as O
well O
as O
two O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
for O
his O
anemia. O
He O
was O
initially O
scheduled O
to O
receive O
cycle O
2 O
of O
R-ICE O
on O
8/22 O
but O
that O
was O
delayed O
due O
to O
his O
thrombocytopenia. O
He O
says O
that O
he O
currently O
feels O
cold-intolerance O
and O
fatigue O
that O
is O
the O
same O
as O
when O
he O
first O
started O
his O
chemotherapy O
in O
May. O
He O

I O
made O

that O
the O

approach O
was O
a O
relatively O

which O
may O
lead O
to O
curing O
the O

therapy, O
which O
would O
also O
be O
a O

decision, O

I O
reviewed O
the O
evidence O

suggest O
medical O
treatment O
of O

disease O

only O
affects O

She O
and O
her O

are O
going O
to O
reflect O
on O
these O
recommendations O
and O
get O
back O
to O
me O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O

If O
she O
does O
decide O
to O
undergo O
coronary O

and O
possible O
angioplasty, O
we O
will O
schedule O
her O
immediately O

that O
time, O
emergent B-CAD
catheterization I-CAD
revealed O
massive O
volume O
of O
thrombus O
extending O
throughout O
his O
RCA, O
managed O
with O
extensive O
suction O
catheter O
use O
and O
POBA, B-CAD
with O
a O
good O
angiographic O
result. O
No O
stents B-CAD
were O
placed O
given O
the O
thrombus O
burden. O
Remarkably, O
subsequent O
echocardiogram O
revealed O
normal O
LV O
systolic O
function, O
with O
basal O
inferoposterior O
HK O
noted. O
His O
peak B-CAD
TnI I-CAD
was I-CAD
33.6, I-CAD
his O
peak O
CK O
was O
1710, O
and O
his O
peak O
MB O
was O
87.2. O
He O
had O
a O
relatively O
unremarkable O
course O
post-catheterization; O
plavix B-MEDICATION
initiation O
was O
delayed O
until O
his O
chest O
tube O
was O
removed, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
started O
without O
incident. O
He O
was O
discharged O
2/11/94, O
and O
had O
done O
well O
until O
1/31/2095, O
when O
he O
presented O
to O
WSH O
with O
unstable B-CAD
angina, B-CAD
having O
noted O
new O
sudden O
onset O
angina O
and O
dyspnea O
while O
making O
his O
daily O
walk. O
He O
had O
a O
positive O
troponin, O
and O
was O
taken O
urgently O
to O
cardiac B-CAD
catheterization, I-CAD
which I-CAD
revealed I-CAD
a I-CAD
proximal I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
lesion I-CAD
(felt I-CAD
to I-CAD
be I-CAD
the I-CAD
culprit) I-CAD
and I-CAD
ostial I-CAD
RCA I-CAD
lesion, I-CAD
both O
of O
which O
were O
stented B-CAD
with I-CAD
CYPHER I-CAD
stents. I-CAD
At O
that O
time O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
increase O
his O
plavix O
from O
75 O
to O
150 O
as O
an O
attempt O
to O
maximize O
his O
medical O
management, O
given O
his O
history O
and O
disease O
burden. O
Since O
that O
admission, O
he O
has O
done O
exceedingly O
well, O
and O
presents O
today O
without O
complaints. O
He O
continues O
to O
walk O
2 O
miles O
~4 O
times/week O
without O
exertional O
symptoms. O
He O
specifically O
denies O
chest O
pain, O
dyspnea, O
orthopnea, O
PND, O
or O
lower O
extremity O
edema. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
palpitations, O
dizziness/presyncope, O
or O
claudication. O
He O
has O
significantly O
modified O
his O
diet O
to O
eliminate O
dairy O
and O
hydrogenated O
products/snacks, O
with O
a O
5# O
weight O
loss, O
and O
is O
motivated O
to O
further O
reduce O
his O
weight. O
He O
states O
that O
he O
feels O
'great' O
and O
isdoing O
quite O
well. O
He O
does O
not O
that O
occasionally O
at O
this O
work, O
when O
he O
is O
frustrated/upset, O
he O
will O
take O
his O
pressure O
and O
find O
his O
systolic O
to O
be O
~150, O
but O
this O
comes O
down O
within O
minutes O
if O
he O
relaxes, O
and O
his O
pressures O
are O
great O
at O
home. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
GI O
symptoms O
on O
the O
aggressive O
antiplatelet O
regimen, O
despite O
not O
being O
on O
a O
PPI. O
Regarding O
his O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer, O
it O
is O
my O
understanding O
that O
he O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
metastatic O
disease O
and O
that O
margins O
were O
negative; O
he O
is O
not O
currently O
planned O
for O
any O
adjuvant O
therapy, O
but O
will O
be O
closely O
followed. O
His O
most O
recent O
imaging O
was O
11/94, O
which O
was O
negative O
for O
evidence O
of O

by O

Regarding O
his O

he O
is O

In O
summary, O
this O
is O
a O
54 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
had O
a O
VF O
arrest O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
perioperative O
inferior O
STEMI, O
status O
post O
extensive O
angiojet O
and O
POBA O
of O
acute O
in-stent O
thrombosis O
of O
presumed O
bare O
metal O
stents O
in O
his O
RCA, O
who O
represented O
1 O
year O
later O
(1/95) O
with O
NSTEMI O
now O
s/p O
PCI O
to O
his O
RCA O
and O
LAD. O
He O
is O
now O
asymptomatic O
status O
post O
this O
intervention O
Given O
his O
history, O
we O
agree O
with O
antiplatelet O
therapy, O
with O
a O
plan O
for O
lifelong O
plavix O
and O
aspirin. O
Should O
he O
require O
future O
invasive O
diagnostic O
procedures, O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
decrease O
doses O
to O
75 O
plavix/81 O
ASA, O
but O
we O
would O
not O
favor O
DC O
of O
either O
of O
these O
medications O
altogether. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
are O
well O
controlled O
on O
his O
current O
regimen, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
his O
home O
records. O
His O
LDL O
is O
near O
goal, O
with O
a O
low O
HDL O
that O
was O
unaffected O
by O
high-dose O
niaspan O
in O
the O
past. O
I O
share O
his O
hope O
that O
with O
further O
diet/weight O
loss O
and O
exercise, O
these O
will O
both O
improve O
to O
goal. O
As O
I O
have O
discussed O
with O
he O
and O
his O
wife, O
given O
his O
history O
of O
Hodgkin's, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
known O
CAD, O
he O
is O
clearly O
at O
risk O
for O
future O
events, O
including O
the O
possibility O
of O
bypass O
surgery O
in O
the O
future. O
We O
will O
be O
guided O
by O
his O
symptoms, O
and O
he O
knows O
to O
call O
me O
if O
he O
has O
any O
problems/symptoms. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Hall O
in O
cardiology O
clinic O
today. O
I O
will O
plan O
to O
see O
him O
in O
follow-up O
in O
6 O
months O
time, O
but O
he O
knows O
to O
call O
sooner O
should O
he O
have O
any O
problems O
or O
concerns. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
A O
65-year-old O
female O
who O
presents O
today O
for O
hospital O
followup. O
I O
admitted O
her O
to O
the O
HH O
on O
10/03/79 O
with O
an O
episode O
of O
hypoxemia, O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
secondary O
to O
CHF O
and O
diastolic O
dysfunction. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
johnson O
rest O
home O
on O
10/12/79. O
Two O
hours O
after O
arrival, O
she O
had O
a O
respiratory O
arrest O
and O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
at O
Clinica O
Rovira O
where O
she O
stayed O
until O
11/03/79. O
She O
is O
extremely O
difficult O
to O
diurese O
because O
of O
her O
tenuous O
renal O
function, O
this O
required O
multiple O
adjustments O
of O
her O
medication. O
Stress O
test O
showed O
no O
ischemia O
and O
echocardiogram O
showed O
concentric O
left O
ventricular O
hypertrophy O
with O
normal O
chamber O
size O
and O
systolic O
function, O
estimated O
ejection O
fraction O
is O
65% O
as O
well O
as O
biatrial O
enlargement O
. O
She O
did O
well O
acutely O
with O
BiPAP O
and O
remains O
on O
oxygen. O
As O
part O
of O
her O
workup, O
she O
had O
pulmonary O
function O
tests, O
which O
showed O
moderate O
obstruction O
without O
a O
bronchodilator O
response O
and O
some O
mild O
restriction O
likely O
due O
to O
her O
obesity. B-OBESE
In O
addition, O
she O
was O
quite O
anemic O
with O
hematocrit O
of O
19 O
on O
presentation. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
hemolysis. O
She O
is O
mildly O
iron O
deficient O
and O
colonoscopy O
showed O
a O
tubulovillous O
adenoma, O
which O
was O
excised O
as O
well O
as O
a O
short O
area O
of O
Barrett's O
esophagus. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
active O
bleeding. O
She O
received O
multiple O
transfusions O
throughout O
her O
stay O
and O
was O
started O
on O
darbepoetin, O
for O
what O
was O
ultimately O
felt O
to O
be O
anemia O
of O
renal O
disease. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
Lahey O
Clinic O
and O
has O
just O
returned O
home. O
Her O
son, O
Brendon O
Ambrose O
who O
was O
the O
healthcare O
proxy, O
is O
here O
with O
her O
today. O
Today, O
she O
feels O
reasonably O
well. O
She O
is O
still O
somewhat O
weak O
from O
the O
prolonged O
hospitalization, O
but O
is O
quite O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
lost O
30 O
pounds. O
She O
is O
taking O
her O
medications O
regularly O
and O
remains O
on O
2 O

She O
has O
no O

about O

Chronic O
renal O
insufficiency. O
Creatinine O
at O
baseline O

She O
will O
need O
to O
be O
watched O
closely. O
She O
expressed O
interest O
in O
possibility O
of O
her O
renal O
transplant O
should O
that O
become O
necessary. O
There O
has O
been O
a O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
she O
has O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
based O
on O
a O
Doppler O
ultrasound O
done O
during O
rehabilitation. O
I O
think O
this O
must O
have O
been O
done O
at O
Brookwood O
Hospital O
because O
no O
studies O
are O
available O
in O
the O
HH O
system. O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
had O
done O
MRA O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago, O
which O
showed O
no O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
at O
that O
time, O
but O
her O
worsening O
renal O
function O
is O
new. O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
next O
week O
and O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
her O
expressly O
raising O
this O
issue. O
Her O
son O
brought O
up O
the O
issue O
of O
perhaps O
consolidating O
all O
her O
care O
at O
the O
HH O
,in O
particular O
is O
seeing O
a O
nephrologist O
here. O
She O
is O
quite O
fond O
of O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
who O
has O
cared O
for O
her O
for O
years, O
but O
I O
think O
given O
the O
complexity O
of O
medical O
care. O
this O
might O
not O
be O
a O
bad O
idea. O
She O
is O
going O
to O
discuss O
with O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
and O
I O
will O
E-mail O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
as O
well. O

she O
will O

this. O

Heme. O
Her O
anemia O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
iron O

and O

of O
renal O

She O
needed O
several O
transfusions O
during O
the O
hospitalization. O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Hematology O
at O
Stone-Wheeling O
in O
January. O
In O
the O

I O
have O
spoken O
to O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
who O
agrees O
to O
monitor O
her O
in O
the O
Renal O
Department O
at O
St. O

If O
necessary, O
they O
can O
give O
her O

Illness O
This O
69 O
yo O
gentleman O
has O
a O
hx B-CAD
of I-CAD
CAD B-CAD
dating O
back O
several O
years. O
He O
underwent O
CABG B-CAD
x I-CAD
3 I-CAD
in I-CAD
2092 I-CAD
at O
WMMC O
after O
being O
diagnosed O
with O
CAD O
after O
presenting O
with O
symptoms O
of O
jaw O
pain O
and O
SOB. O
Immediately O
after O
surgery O
he O
was O
told O
there O
was O
likely O
a O
problem O
with O
one O
of O
the O
grafts. O
He O
began O
to O
have O
symptoms O
of O
jaw O
pain O
and O
dypnea O
within O
a O
few O
weeks O
of O
surgery O
and O
presented O
to O
Beloit O
State O
where O
he O
had O
cath B-CAD
within I-CAD
6 I-CAD
weeks I-CAD
of I-CAD
CABG- I-CAD
at I-CAD
that I-CAD
time I-CAD
his I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
graft I-CAD
was I-CAD
down I-CAD
and I-CAD
his I-CAD
distal B-CAD
LAD I-CAD
was I-CAD
stenosed. I-CAD
Failed O
attempt O
to O
stent O
the O
distal O
LAD, O
but O
it O
was O
PTCA'd B-CAD
with O
no O
real O
relief O
of O
his O
symptoms. O
Last O
year, O
he O
presented O
here O
with O
further O
progression O
of O
his O
anginal O
equivalent O
and O
underwent O
cath B-CAD
which I-CAD
showed I-CAD
further B-CAD
stenosis I-CAD
of I-CAD
the I-CAD
distal I-CAD
LAD. I-CAD
There O
was O
no O
PCI O
option O
available. O
He O
has O
been O
aggressively O
managed O
with O
medications O
and O
initially O
his O
jaw O
pain O
improved, O
but O
the O
dyspnea O
has O
persisted. O
Unfortunately O
the O
jaw O
pain O
has O
reoccurred O
and O
he O
has O
become O
more O
symptomatic. O
He O
now O
presented O
for O
cath. O
Today B-CAD
he I-CAD
arrived I-CAD
via I-CAD

Dear O
Miles: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Vicente O
in O
Cardiovascular O
Care O
today. O
This O
lovely O
77-year O
old O
man O
has O
had O
past O
medical O
history O
notable O
for O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
depression, O
insomnia, O
osteoarthritis O
status O
post O
total O
knee O
replacement. O
He O
presents O
today O
because O
of O
a O
recent O
exacerbation O
of O
symptomatic O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
His O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
begins O
with O
his O
presentation O
following O
his O
total O
knee O
replacement O
in O
June O
of O
2091. O
In O
10/91 O
he O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
profound O
weakness O
and O
sat O
down. O
He O
had O
no O
clear O
substernal O
chest O
pressure, O
loss O
of O
consciousness O
or O
edema. O
Workup O
at O
that O
time O
included O
a O
thallium O
test O
which O
did O
not O
clearly O
demonstrate O
ischemia O
and O
an O
echocardiogram O
with O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
50%. O
He O
began O
therapy O
at O
that O
point O
in O
time O
with O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
niacin, B-MEDICATION
vitamin O
E, O
Lasix, O
Zestril, B-MEDICATION
Zantac, O
Minipress, O
Amitriptyline, O
and O
Digoxin. O
He O
had O
been O
free O
of O
exertional O
neck, O
chest, O
arm O
and O
jaw O
pain, O
paroxysmal O
nocturnal O
dyspnea, O
orthopnea, O
palpitations, O
claudication O
and O
TIA O
until O
this O
past O
spring. O
He O
actually O
had O
done O
very O
well O
with O
risk O
factor O
reduction O
including O
completing O
cardiac O
rehab O
at O
MJH O
and O
following O
a O
stringent O
weight O
reduction O
program O
and O
decreasing O
his O
weight. O
In O
March O
of O
2094 O
he O
began O
noticing O
that O
when O
he O
was O
going O
up O
the O
19 O
steps O
in O
his O
house O
he O
began O
having O
mid-sternal B-CAD
chest I-CAD
discomfort I-CAD
and I-CAD
some I-CAD
dyspnea I-CAD
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stairs. O
He O
stopped O
working O
with O
the O
physiotherapist O
at O
that O
point O
and O
was O
initiated O
on O
nitrate B-MEDICATION
therapy. O
Since O
that O
time O
he O
has O
noted O
that O
he O
has O
had O
significant O
decrease O
in O
symptoms O
and O
over O
the O
past O
week O
has O
actually O
had O
no O
need O
to O
take O
sublingual B-MEDICATION
nitroglycerine B-MEDICATION
and O
has O
been O
taking O
the O
full O
flight O
of O
stairs O
without O
difficulty. O
He O
does O
note O
fatigue O
and O
insomnia O
such O
that O
he O
is O
sleeping O
only O
2 O
to O
3 O
hours O
a O
night. O
He O
does O
continue O
to O
be O
free O
of O
paroxysmal O
nocturnal O
dyspnea, O
orthopnea, O
palpitations O
or O
lightheadedness. O
Medical O
regimen O
includes O
Ambien, O
Paxil, O
Isordil B-MEDICATION
20 O
t.i.d., O
Atenolol, B-MEDICATION
Digoxin, O
Zantac O
and O
aspirin. O
He O
has O
no O
known O
drug O
allergies. O
On O
physical O
exam O
blood O
pressure O
when O
he O
first O
arrived O
at O
Clinic O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
220/100. B-HYPERTENSION
At I-HYPERTENSION
the I-HYPERTENSION
present I-HYPERTENSION
time I-HYPERTENSION

Page O
Two O
heart O
rate O
of O
55 O
and O
a O
respiratory O
rate O
of O
10. O
There O
is O
no O
increase O
in O
jugular O
venous O
pressure. O
His O
carotids O
are O
free O
of O
bruits. O
His O
lungs O
are O
entirely O
clear O
to O
auscultation O
throughout, O
and O
cardiac O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
non-displaced O
PMI, O
S1 O
and O
physiologically-split O
S2 O
with O
no O
murmur, O
rub O
or O
gallop. O
Abdominal O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
ventral O
hernia. O
There O
is O
no O
organomegaly O
and O
neither O
are O
there O
bruits O
present. O
Lower O
extremities O
are O
notable O
for O
2+ O
femoral, O
popliteal, O
dorsalis O
pedis O
and O
posterior O
tibial O
pulses O
with O
no O
edema. O
Skin O
exam O
is O
notable O
only O
for O
the O
senile O
angioma. O
Electrocardiogram O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block O
which O
is O
new O
since O
prior O
tracing O
available O
here O
of O
4/03/94. O
MIBI O
was O
notable O
only O
for O
a O
potential O
fixed O
anteroseptal O
defect O
and O
no O
significant O
ischemia O
on O
5/6/94. O
The O
ejection O
fraction O
on O
a O
gated O
spect O
was O
57%. O
In O
summary, O
it O
appears O
that O
Mr. O
Vicente O
may O
have O
experienced O
a O
new O
myocardial O
infarction O
resulting O
in O
a O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block O
in O
March O
of O
2094. O
He O
could, O
however, O
also O
have O
developed O
his O
progressive O
conduction O
system O
disease O
and O
have O
the O
fixed O
defect O
on O
his O
MIBI O
attributable O
only O
to O
a O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block. O
I O
will O
be O
reviewing O
the O
primary O
images O
to O
make O
my O
final O
decision. O
In O
either O
regard O
he O
is O
now O
free O
of O
symptoms O
on O
his O
current O
medical O
regimen O
despite O
his O
increased O
weight O
and O
his O
increased O
blood O
pressure. O
I O
certainly O
agree O
with O
further O
assistance O
from O
nutrition O
and O
weight O
loss O
and O
proceeding O
with O
Imdur B-MEDICATION
therapy O
which O
I O
would O
increase O
to O
60 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
I O
also O
would O
consider O
further O
decrease O
of O
his O
LDL O
with O
statin O
therapy O
but O
would O
only O
consider O
this O
after O
assessing O
his O
response O
to O
re-initiation O
his O
nutrition O
program. O
Given O
his O
lack O
of O
symptoms O
at O
the O
present O
time O
with O
his O
usual O
daily O
activity, O
I O
would O
prefer O
to O
proceed O
on O
the O
medical O
therapy O
route. O
I O
think O
that O
he O
could O
be O
reintroduced O
to O
rehab O
at O
MJH O
with O
the O
hopes O
that O
further O
education O
can O
get O
him O
back O
on O
line O
in O
terms O
of O
risk O
factor O
reduction. O
I O
certainly O
look O
forward O
to O
discussing O
this O
case O
further O
with O
you. O
It's O
certainly O
a O
pleasure O
to O
participate O
in O
his O
care. O
