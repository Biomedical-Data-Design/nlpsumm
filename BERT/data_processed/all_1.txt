MR O

Dear O
Patricia: O
I O
saw O
Brady O
Duvall O
again O
today. O
He O
has O
been O
very O
stable O
clinically O
over O
these O
past O
six O
months. O
I O
believe O
this O
represents O
a O
composite O
of O
the O
following O
three O
major O
changes O
in O
his O
medical O
regimen. O
As O
you O
know, O
we O
have O
discontinued B-MEDICATION
all I-MEDICATION
beta I-MEDICATION
blockers, I-MEDICATION
and O
this O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
a O
symptomatic O
stability. O
He O
had O
biventricular O
pacing O
box O
placed, O
certainly O
contributing O
to O
his O
overall O
improved O
status O
and O
he O
is O
now O
taking O
a O
regular O
dose O
of O
Lasix. O
He O
is O
on O
80 O
mg O
alternating O
with O
40 O
mg O
per O
day. O
He O
does O
have O
symptoms O
of O
fatigue, O
but O
his O
overall O
volume O
status O
is O
quite O
reasonable. O
He O
is O
currently O
on O
Aldactone O
25 O
mg O
daily O
and O
Lasix O
80 O
mg O
per O
day O
alternating O

His O
amiodarone O
has O
been O
discontinued. O
He O
does O
have O
asymptomatic O
ventricular O
tachycardia, O
often O
paced O
out O
of O
this, O
but O
I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
recommend O
ablation O
therapy O
for O
him O
at O
the O
present O
time. O
He O
has O
not O
been O
shocked O
by O
his O
ICD. O
Functionally O
he O
seems O
quite O
stable. O
He O
does O
have O
mild O
fatigue, O
but O
is O
otherwise O
reasonably O
active. O
He O
will O
hopefully O
be O
traveling O
to O
Miami O
this O
spring. O
Physical O
examination O
today O
is O
of O
note O
for O
a O
weight O
of O
184 O
lbs. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
is O
118/70, O
his O
resting O
pulse O
69. O
His O
neck O
veins O
are O
in O
fact, O
quite O
unimpressive. O
There O
is O
minimal O
jugular O
distention, O
perhaps O
6-7 O
cm. O
There O
is O
no O

If O

She O
tolerated O

quite O
well O
and O
had O
a O
short O

Currently, O
she O
is O
doing O
some O

is O
still O
feeling O
quite O
tired O
and O
a O

deconditioned. O
However, O
her O
breathing O
does O
feel O
better O
than O
prior O
to O
the O
surgery. O
She O
has O
some O
residual O
sternal O

but O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
her O

COMPLAINT: O
The O
patient O
presents O
for O

of O
chronic O
neck O
and O
left O
arm O
pain. O
HPI: O
This O

with O
worsening O
neck O
and O
left O
arm O
pain, O
which O
is O
now O
interfering O

his O
daily O
life. O

has O
had O
a O
chronic O
arthritic O
pain O
throughout O
his O
body, O

he O
has O
been O
complaining O
of O
for O
approximately O
10 O
years O
involving O
his O
neck, O
shoulder, O
arms, O
knees, O
and O
back. O
More O
recently O
in O
the O
past O
months O
to O
couple O
of O
years, O
his O
neck, O
left O
arm, O
and O
shoulder O
pain O
have O
been O
his O
predominant O
pain O
symptoms. O
It O
has O
been O
a O
gradual O
onset. O
He O
has O
had O
similar O
problems O
in O
the O

RECOMMENDATIONS: O
1. O
Given O
the O
multiple O
etiologies O
possible O
for O
his O
symptoms O
in O
his O
left O
arm, O
which O
are O
his O
predominant O
symptoms: O
Brachial O
plexopathy O
versus O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
versus O
cervical O
radiculopathy, O
we O
have O
referred O
the O
patient O
for O
an O
EMG O
to O
delineate O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
symptoms. O
2. O
He O
will O
return O
to O
clinic O
after O
his O
EMG O
and O
from O
that O
point, O
we O
will O
decide O
the O
course O
of O
action O
for O
pain O
management. O
At O
this O
time, O
he O
will O
continue O
on O
the O
Neurontin O
200 O
mg O
two O
times O
a O
day. O
We O
will O

Dear O
Dr O
Chavez, O
Mr. O
William O
Le O
return O
for O
follow-up O
in O
the O
Neurology O
clinic O
today. O
He O
still O
has O
significant O
difficulty O
walking, O
and O
he O
is O
falling O
frequently O
at O
home. O
He O
has O
not O
sustained O
any O
significant O
injuries. O
He O
has O
numbness O
and O
paresthesias O
of O
his O
feet, O
but O
there O
has O
been O
no O
interval O
change O
in O
his O
symptoms O
since O
his O
last O
visit O
in O
November O
2162. O
Medications: O
Neurontin O
300mg O

Lasix O
40mg O
daily, O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
Atenolol B-MEDICATION
50mg O
daily, O
Zetia B-MEDICATION
10mg, O
Pravastatin B-MEDICATION
20mg, O
Nexium O
and O
multi O
vitamins. O
Examination: O
reveals O
that O
strength O
testing O
in O
the O
legs O
is O
normal. O
He O
has O
absent O
deep O
tendon O
reflexes O
of O
the O
ankles, O
trace O
to O
1+ O
at O
the O
knees. O
Romberg's O
test O
is O
positive, O
and O
the O
patient O
has O
difficulty O
standing O
without O
assistance. O
Despite O
the O
degree O
of O
sensory O
ataxia, O
he O
is O
still O
able O
to O
feel O
position O
sense O
at O
the O
metatarsophalangeal O
joints O
in O
his O
feet. O
Vibration O
and O
pinprick O
sensation O
are O
diminished. O
Data O
Review: O
The O
patient O
does O
have O
a O
persistent O
low O
concentration O
of O
monoclonal O
protein O
in O
the O
slow O
gamma O
region. O
This O
is O
unchanged O
compared O
to O
the O
previous O
study O
done O
in O
February O
2162. O
This O
most O
likely O
is O
a O
MGUS. O
Impression O
and O
Recommendation: O
The O
patient O
has O
poorly O
controlled O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
complicated O
by O
polyneuropathy. O
The O
monoclonal O
protein O
is O
an O
incidental O
finding O
and O
is O
probably O
not O
accounting O
for O
his O
peripheral O
neuropathy. O
Given O
that O
the O
monoclonal O
protein O
has O
not O
changed O
in O
concentration O
or O
character O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
additional O
testing O
at O
this O
stage. O
He O
will O
continue O
with O
Neurontin O
to O
manage O
his O
neuropathic O
symptoms. O
I O
have O
urged O
him O
to O
try O
and O
maintain O
good O
diabetic O
control. O

I O

As O
you O
know, O
she O
has O
been O
complaining O
of O
leg O
cramps O
mostly O
at O
night. O
She O
has O
been O
taking O
quinine O
for O
this, O
however O
develops O
palpitations O
whenever O
she O
takes O
the O
quinine. O
She O
has O
not O
been O
taking O
this O
since O
the O
initial O
two O
doses. O
I O
suspect O
that O
her O
leg O
cramps O
are O
probably O
secondary O
to O
intermittent O
passing O
fluxes. O
I O
have O
told O
her O
to O
eat O
a O
banana O
during O
the O
evening O
and O
possibly O
this O
would O
avoid O
leg O
cramps O
in O
the O
evening. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
her O
EKG O
showed O
sinus O
bradycardia O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
50 O
per O
minute. O
There O
is O
borderline O

Dear O
Usha: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
one O
of O
your O
clinic O
patients, O
Ms. O
Wonda O
Benitez, O
in O
my O
cardiovascular O
clinic O
for O
follow-up O
status O
post B-CAD
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
bypass I-CAD
surgery I-CAD
and O
pounding O
headaches. O
As O
you O
know, O
we O
performed O
a O
persantine B-CAD
MIBI B-CAD
recently I-CAD
which I-CAD
showed I-CAD
inferior B-CAD
wall I-CAD
ischemia. I-CAD
I O
wasn't O
sure O
whether O
or O
not O
this O
ischemia O
was O
new. O
On O
review O
of O
her O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
surgery O
notes, O
she O
did O
not O
have O
her O
totally O
occluded O
right O
coronary O
artery O
bypass. O
Therefore, O
I O
suggest O
that O
this O
reversible O
ischemia O
in O
the O
inferior O
wall O
is O
probably O
old O
and O
was O
the O
result O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
did O
not O
bypass O
this O
area. O
She O
did O
have O
a O
LIMA B-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
and I-CAD
two I-CAD
saphenous I-CAD
venous I-CAD
grafts I-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
circumflex I-CAD
territory, I-CAD
the I-CAD
OM I-CAD
and I-CAD
the I-CAD
diagonal. I-CAD
She O
has O
been O
doing O
relatively O
well O
with O
chest O
discomfort O
and O
I O
recommended O
we O
continue O
her O
current O
cardiac O
medications. O
However, O
she O
has O
been O
complaining O
of O
pounding O
headaches O
and O
she O
did O
have O
a O
history O
of O
otitis O
media O
in O
her O
right O
ear. O
Therefore, O
I O
think O
it O
wouldn't O
be O
unreasonable O
to O
refer O
her O
to O
ENT O
to O
have O
them O
evaluate O
her O
ears O
as O
a O
possible O
source O
of O
her O
pounding O
headaches. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
have O
suggested O
that O
she O
take O
her O
nifedipine B-MEDICATION
and O
nitroglycerin B-MEDICATION
in O
the O
event O
that O
her O
blood O
pressure O
shoots O
up O
during O
these O
episodes. O
I O
suspect O
that O
her O
blood O
pressure O
rise O
during O
these O
episodes O
is O
due O
more O
to O
anxiety O
than O
to O
intrinsic O
problem O
with O
her O
cardiovascular O
system. O
She O
will O
return O
to O
see O
me O
in O
follow-up O
in O
three O
months O
time, O
at O
which O
time O
I O
will O
check O
her O
cholesterol O
level. O
Again, O
thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
your O
patient. O
Please O
do O

occurred O
during O

I O
am O

of O
an O

IMPRESSION: O
I O
think O
we O
should O
schedule O
Ms. O
Benitez O
for O
a O
Persantine O
thallium O
test O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
If O
she O
can O
exercise O
on O
this O
test, O
that O
would O
be O
even O
better. O
When O
the O
results O
are O
back, O
I O
will O
get O
back O
you O
regarding O
further O
recommendations. O
My O
hope O
is O
that O
we O
will O
not O
have O
to O
revascularize O
her O
again. O
If O
we O
do, O
I O
am O
hoping O
to O
do O
so O
with O
potential O
angioplasty O
and O
stenting. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
have O
switched B-MEDICATION
her I-MEDICATION
from I-MEDICATION
Zocor B-MEDICATION
40 O
mg O
to O
Lipitor B-MEDICATION
40 O
mg O
a O
day O
in O
the O
hopes O
of O
targeting O
her O
LDL O
cholesterol O
to O
the O
new O
guidelines O
of O
100. O
Her O
previous B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
LDL B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
cholesterol I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
was I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
111. I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
I O
also O
suggested O
to O
her O
in O
the O
meantime O
to O
cut O
down O
on O
her O
physical O
activities O
until O
we O
know O
the O
results O
of O
the O
thallium O
test O
and O
also O
to O
forgo O
one O
episode O
of O
her O
steroid O
injection O
for O
her O
back. O
Please O
let O
me O
know O
if O
you O
have O
any O
further O
questions O
or O
concerns O
regarding O
this O
patient. O
Again, O
thank O
you O
for O
referring O
her O
to O
our O
clinic. O

Dear O
Usha: O
I O
just O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Ms. O
Benitez O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
cardiovascular O
examination. O
She O
has O
been O
reasonably O
stable O
since O
I O
saw O
her O
last O
in O

She O
has O
had O
several O

characterized O
as O
a O
tightness O
which O
has O
been O
quite O
transient. O
The O
frequency O
has O
been O
less O
than O
one O

does O
admit O
to O
back O

She O
still O

with O
a O
greater O

She O
has O
occasional B-CAD
and I-CAD
very I-CAD
transient I-CAD
episodes I-CAD
of I-CAD
angina. I-CAD
I O
have O
suggested O
continuing O
her O
current O
medical O
regimen. O
As O
noted O
previously, O
I O
prefer O
to O
manage O
her O
medically O
unless O
her O
symptoms O
worsen. O
2. O
Carotid O
artery O
disease. O
She O
is O
asymptomatic. O
I O
recommend O
periodic O
surveillance O
with O
carotid O
ultrasound. O
3. O
Peripheral O
arterial O
disease. O
Both O
grafts O
are O
patent O
but O
the O
left O
femoral-anterior O
bypass O
graft O
appears O
by O
ultrasound O
to O
have O
a O
significant O

I O
have O
asked O

this O

Assessment O

In O
summary, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
61-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
a O
big B-CAD
anteroseptal I-CAD
MI I-CAD
approximately O
six O
years O
ago. O
He O
has O
had O
stenting B-CAD
of I-CAD
his I-CAD
coronaries I-CAD
in I-CAD
2076. I-CAD
He O
is O
without O
any O
evidence O
of O
ischemia O
at O
this O
time. O
He O
has O
a O
fairly O
good O
LV O
function. O
There O
is O
an O
LV O
aneurysm, O
but O
Coumadin O
has O
been O
deferred O
and O
he O
has O
been O
treated O
with O
aspirin O
and O
Plavix. O
He O
is O
on O
a O
good O
medical O
regimen. O
Blood O
pressure O
seems O
to O
be O
well O
controlled. O
He O
does O
not O
have O
any O
evidence O
of O
severe O
decompensated O
congestive O
heart O
failure. O
He O
does O
have O
some O
trace O
pedal O
edema. O
His O
weight O
has O
gone O
up O
significantly O
since O
the O
operation O
for O
his O
hip O
and O
I O
have O
encouraged O
him O
to O
start O
walking O
program O
and O
try O
and O
drop O
off O
that O
weight O
this O
summer. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
do O
CBC, O
electrolytes, O
creatinine, O
BUN, O
and O
a O
CBC O
with O
lipids O
today. O
My O
plan O
would O
be O
keep O
him O
on O
his O
current O
regimen O
and O
see O
him O
back O
here O
in O
another O
six O
months O
to O
see O
how O
he O
is O
doing O
with O
his O
weight. O
Cholesterol O
has O
been O
in O
very O
good O
shape O
and O
I O
do O
not O
expect O
that O
to O
be O
a O
problem. O

approximately O
six O

stenting B-CAD
at I-CAD
that I-CAD
time, I-CAD
and I-CAD
subsequently I-CAD
had I-CAD
another I-CAD
stent I-CAD
placed I-CAD
in I-CAD

He O
has O
been O
noted O

which O
may O
have O
been O
myocardial B-CAD

and O
angina. O
His O
blood O

was O
elevated, O
so O
we O
added B-MEDICATION

to O
control O
the O

He O
has O
had O

There O

I O
suspect O
that O

with O
differences O

I O
have O
talked O
with O
the O

about O
cardiac O

and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
get O
him O
in O

we O
can O
assess O
the O
degree O
of O
coronary O
disease. O
Hopefully O
it O
is O
amenable O
to O
percutaneous O
angioplasty, O
but O
I O
am O
somewhat O
concerned O
about O
the O

We O
will O
arrange O
for O
cardiac O

either O
next O

I O
will O

the O
Comfrey O

She O

of I-CAD
a B-CAD

at I-CAD
this I-CAD

she I-CAD
had I-CAD

a I-CAD

The O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O

the O
diagonal B-CAD

was I-CAD
patent I-CAD
with I-CAD
a I-CAD
significant I-CAD

its O
distal O

astigmatic O
site, O
a O
saphenous O

was O
patent O
as O
was O
the O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
to O
the O
posterolateral O
branch. O
The O
left O
intramammary O
artery O
to O
the O
LAD O
was O
a O
small O

Presently, O
Mrs. O
Olivier O
has O
evidence O
of O

which O
she O
believes O
is O

In O
this O
setting, O
a O
dobutamine O

test O
performed O
last O
June O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
provokable O
ischemia. O
I O
have O
spent O
some O
time O
discussing O
with O
Ms. O
Olivier O
our O
various O
therapeutic O
and O
diagnostic O
options. O
She O
made O
it O
quite O
clear O
that O
she O
would O
not O
consider O
repeat O
cardiac O
catheterization O
at O
this O
time, O
and O
furthermore, O
was O
very O
disinterested O
in O
pursuing O
the O
possibility O
(should O
she O
require O
it) O
of O
either O
mechanical O
or O
surgical O
re- O
vascularization. O
It O
is O
not O
entirely O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
her O
left O
shoulder O
syndrome O
is O
in O
fact O
ischemic O
in O
origin, O
and O
she O
certainly O
understands O
it O
may O
be O
secondary O
to O
musculoskeletal O
abnormalities. O
I O
have O
suggested O
that O
she O
discuss O
that O
further O
with O
you. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
have O
asked O
her O
(as O
her O
back O
and O
chest O
discomfort O
syndrome O
appears O
to O
occur O
mostly O
at O
night O
prior O
to O
lying O
down O

to O
apply O
her O
Nitropatch O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
take O
it O
off O
in O
the O
morning. O
She O
will O
call O
me O
within O
the O
next O
several O
days O
to O
report O
how O
this O
helps O
her O
discomfort O
syndrome. O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
she O
is O
having O
GERD O
to O
explain O
her O
symptoms. O
In O
light O
of O
her O
reluctance O
to O
undergo O
any O
further O
diagnostic O
cardiac O
studies, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
tailor O
her O
anti-ischemic O
medications O
to O
minimize O
her O
chest O
discomfort O
syndrome. O
I, O
of O
course, O
will O
keep O
you O
fully O
informed O
as O
to O
her O
progress, O

Dear O
Mr. O
Louis, O
It O
was O
very O
nice O
to O
see O
you O
again O
the O
other O
day. O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
doing O
well. O
I O
am O
writing O
to O
let O
you O
know O
about O
your O
recent O
test O
results. O
The O
following O
tests O
were O
essentially O
negative, O
normal, O
or O
unchanged O
from O
prior O
testing O
and O
do O
not O
require O
follow-up O
at O
this O
time. O
1) O
Kidney O
test. O
2) O
Cholesterol. O
Your O
cholesterol O
results O
are O
as O
follows: O
Total O
Cholesterol O
= O
129, O
HDL O
(the O
'good' O
cholesterol) O
= O
43, O
LDL O
(the O
'bad' O
cholesterol) O
= O
70, O
triglycerides O
= O
82. O
My O
records O
indicate O
that O
your O
total O
cholesterol O
has O
increased O
since O
01/11/2072. O
Given O
your O
medical O
history, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
your O
LDL O
(the O
'bad' O
cholesterol) O
below O
100. O
Please O
continue O
to O
follow O
a O
heart-healthy O
diet. O
3) O
Hemoglobin O
A1c. O
This O
is O
a O
blood O
test O
that O
indicates O
how O
well O
you O
have O
controlled O
your O
blood O
sugar O
over O
the O
past O
3 O
months. O
For O
patients O
with O
diabetes, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
it O
below O
7. O
Your O
Hemoglobin O
A1c O
value O
was O
6.5 O
on O
04/04/2073. O
It O
has O
remained O
stable O
compared O
to O
the O
last O
value O
of O
6.5 O
on O
07/12/2072. O
Please O
continue O
to O
check O
your O

take O
Metformin B-MEDICATION

prescribed. O
4) O
X-ray. O
No O
fractures O
were O
detected O
on O
the O
X-ray O
of O
your O
spine, O
but O
it O
did O
show O
changes O
consistent O
with O
osteoarthritis. O
The O
following O
tests O
were O
abnormal O
or O
require O
follow-up. O
1) O
PSA. O
As O
we O
discussed O
during O
our O
visit, O
this O
is O
a O
blood O
test O
that O
measures O
activity O
in O
your O
prostate, O
and O
is O
one O
way O
to O
measure O
your O
potential O
risk O
of O
prostate O
cancer. O
This O
is O
not O
a O
perfect O
test, O
and O
its O
use O
for O
prostate O
cancer O
screening O
is O
controversial. O
My O
records O
indicate O
that O
your O
PSA O
has O
mildly O
increased O
since O
4/01/72. O
I O
recommend O
that O
you O
follow-up O
with O
a O
urologist O
for O
a O
prostate O
biopsy, O
which O
we O
can O
arrange O
when O
you O
return O
for O
your O
follow-up O
appointment. O
At O
that O
time, O
we O
will O
again O
discuss O
the O
specifics O
of O
the O
PSA O
test O
and O
the O
risks/benefits O
of O
different O
treatment/follow-up O
options. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
questions, O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
reach O
me O
at O
my O
office O
at O
191-537-1871. O
I O
will O
see O
you O
on O
5/16/73 O
at O
9:40am O

The O
patient's O
atenolol B-MEDICATION
was O
recently O
decreased O
from O

Dear O
Dr. O
Knapp: O
It O
was O
our O
pleasure O
to O
care O
for O
Mr. O
Osborne O
to O
help O
with O
his O
decompensated O
heart O
failure. O
He O
was O
admitted O
on O
07/23/2082, O
one O
month O
after O
previous O
admission O
for O
abdominal O
pain. O
In O
retrospect, O
that O
admission O
may O
have O
been O
related O
in O
part O
to O
GI O
symptoms O
of O
heart O
failure. O
He O
came O
in O
complaining O
of O
continued O
GI O
discomfort, O
orthopnea, O
lower O
extremity O
edema, O
and O
9 O
pounds O
of O
weight O
gain O
with O
increasing O
abdominal O
girth. O
His O
medications O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
included O
beta-blockers B-MEDICATION
and O
ACE B-MEDICATION
inhibitors I-MEDICATION
for O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
with O
no O
diuretics. O
During O
his O
hospitalization, O
he O
underwent O
7.5 O
kilograms O
of O
diuresis O
with O
resolution O
of O
his O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
from O
approximately O
25 O
cm O
to O
8 O
cm. O
His O
echocardiogram O
showed O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
approximately O
20% O
with O
LV O
dimension O
of O
5.1, O
enlarged O
right O
ventricle O
with O
mild O
decrease O
in O
RV O
function, O
but O
severe O
RV O
pressure O
overload O
with O
estimated O
PA O
pressure O
80 O
plus O
the O
right O
atrial O
pressure. O
After O
he O
had O
his O
diuresis, O
he O
underwent O
right O
heart O
catheterization, O
which O
revealed O
a O
right O
atrial O
pressure O
of O
8, O
pulmonary O
capillary O
wedge O
pressure O
of O
18, O
PA O
pressure O
of O
65/35. O
He O
underwent O
a O
trial O
with O
IV B-MEDICATION
nitroglycerin, B-MEDICATION
then O
with O
sildenafil. O
The O
IV O
nitroglycerin O
decreased O
his O
BLANK O
pressures O
only O
by O
approximately O
8-10 O
mm O
but O
he O
noted O
a O
further O
improvement O
in O
his O
dyspnea. O
There O
was O
no O
clear O
improvement O
with O
the O
sildenafil O
in O
either O
his O
symptoms O
or O
hemodynamics. O
His O
cardiac O
output O
varied O
between O
3.1 O
and O
4.5 O
on O
all O
the O
medications. O
The O
decision O
was O
just O
to O
put O
him O
on O
oral O
nitroglycerin O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
other O
standard O
heart O
failure O
medications. O
He O
also O
underwent O
a O
MIBI O
looking O
for O
any O
evidence O
of O
active O
ischemia, O
which O
there O
was O
none. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge, O
he O
is O
walking O
easily O
without O
postural O
change O
or O
symptoms. O
His O
medications O
are O
Isordil B-MEDICATION
10 O

p.o. O
b.i.d. O
He O
is O
on O

daily. O
His O
lisinopril B-MEDICATION
was O
decreased O
from O
40 O
mg O
to O
20 O
mg, O
but O
should O
he O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
hypotension, O
this O
could O
certainly O
be O
decreased O
further O
to O
10 O
or O
even O
5 O
mg O
if O
necessary O
to O
allow O
him O
comfortable O
ambulation. O
He O
is O
on O
Plavix B-MEDICATION
75 O
mg O
daily O
as O
well O
and O
simvastatin B-MEDICATION
40. O
His O
discharge O
blood O
pressure O
is O
102/60, O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
is O
8-9 O
cm. O
His O
creatinine O
is O

It O
has O
been O
my O
great O
pleasure O
to O
participate O
in O
his O
care. O
He O
is O
trying O
very O
hard O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
manage O
his O
disease O
at O
home, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
his O
family. O
We O
have O
emphasized O
not O
only O
the O
salt O
restriction O
but O
also O
a O
fluid O
restriction O
to O
2 O
liters O
a O
day, O
which O
includes O
all O
fluids, O
We O
would O
encourage O
him O
to O
resume O
his O
daily O
exercise O
such O
as O
walking. O
He O
has O
an O
appointment O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Anderson O
on O
08/20/2081, O
and O
is O
looking O
forward O
to O
returning O
to O
your O
care. O
I O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
answer O
any O
further O
questions O
about O
it. O

Complaint O
& O
Present O
Illness: O
Patient O
briefly O
evaluated O
on O
12/30/88 O
as O
part O
of O
preoperative O
evaluation O
for O
a O
laparoscopic O
cholecystectomy O
then O
scheduled O
for O
12/31/88. O
Over O
the O
past O
year O
patient O
has O
had O
difficulty O
with O
right O
upper O
quadrant O
pain O
as O
well O
as O
epigastric O
pain. O
These O
episodes O
tend O
to O
happen O
more O
frequently O
after O
she O
has O
had O
a O
rich O
meal. O
Other O
symptoms O
that O
occurred O
include O
nausea O
and O
vomiting. O
Patient O
denies O
jaundice. O
Today, O
patient O
states O
that O
she O
still O
has O
some O
abdominal O
tenderness O
greatest O
at O
the O
right O
costal O
margin O
and O
radiating O
into O
right O
flank. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
evaluation O
on O
12/30/88 O
patients O
had O
symptoms O
of O
URI O
and O
LRI. O
She O
reported O
back/green O
sputum, O
mild O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
increased O
use O
of O
her O
grandson's O
inhaler. O
After O
consultation O
with O
Dr. O
Valladares O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
patient O
should O
be O
evaluated O
by O
her O
primary O
care O
provider O
for O
further O
treatment O
of O
her O
respiratory O
tract O
infection O
and O
then O
follow-up O
with O

to O
reschedule O
her O
surgery. O
Patient O
reports O
that O
she O
went O
to O
University O
Hospital O
and O
there O
they O
treated O
her O
with O
antibiotics O
and O
inhaler. O
Unfortunately O
patient O
is O
unable O
to O
recall O
the O
name O
of O
the O
antibiotic O
or O

Currently O
she O
denies O
any O
symptoms O
of O
sputum O
production, O
cough, O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
or O
wheezing. O
Also O
denies O
fever, O
chills, O
nausea, O
vomiting, O
and O
diarrhea. O
Patient O
does O
have O
a O

and O
a O

12/09/82 O
patient O
underwent O

She O
has O
had O

however, O
these O

pacemaker- O
complicated O
by O
brief O
arterial O
puncture, O
prompt O
removal O
of O

catheter O
and O
successful O
compression. O
Duplex O
ultrasonography O
after O

showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
pseudoaneurysm. O
A O
CTA O
done O
yesterday O
to O
evaluate O
his O
thyroid O
was O
read O
as: O
' O
Hematoma O
around O
right O
subclavian O

Narrowing O

the O

most O

If O

is O

be O
obtained.' O
On O
physical O
examination, O
he O
has O
mild O
non O
expansile O
hematoma O
of O
the O
right O
chest O
wall. O
His O
right O
hand O
is O
warm O

well O
perfused, O
with O
1+ O

There O
are O
no O

My O
review O
of O
arterial O
components O
of O
the O
CT O
show O
the O
following: O
1). O
Hematoma- O
to O
be O
expected O
2). O
Diffuse O
arterial O
calcifications- O
obscures O
the O
ability O
to O
read O
what O
is O
or O
is O
not O
in O
the O

3). O
Venous O
contrast O
bolus O
delivered O
on O
the O
right O
side- O
obscures O
our O
ability O
to O
discern O
the O
anatomy O

the O
area O
of O
the O
subclavian O
artery. O
4). O
Contrast O
bolus O
inadequate O
to O
comment O
on O
arterial O
anatomy. O
Based O
on O
his O
clinical O
exam, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
on O
an O
anticoagulant, O
a O
follow O
up O
subclavian O
artery O
ultrasound O
examination O
is O
in O
order. O
This O
test O
should O
be O
geared O
towards O
determining O
whether O
there O
is O
any O
evidence O
of O
a O
pseudoaneurysm. O
If O
there O
is O
an O
intraarterial O
filling O
defect, O
I O
would O
not O
pursue O
it. O
He O
is O
anticoagulated O
and O
his O

is O

There O
are O
no O

Dear O
Dr. O
Lopez: O
Thanks O
very O
much O
for O
referring O
Mr. O
Nielson O
to O
see O
me O
for O
evaluation O
of O
his O
lymphadenopathy. O
I O
will O
review O
his O
history O
for O
you. O
Mr. O
Nielson O
is O
a O
76-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
states O
that O
approximately O
three O
months O
ago, O
he O
had O
some O
increased O
swelling O
of O
his O
left O
leg. O
About O
three O
to O
four O
weeks O
ago, O
this O
became O
increasingly O
evident O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
at O
Elders O
Home O
in O
Brandon, O
Indiana. O
At O
that O
point, O
a O
CT O
scan O
was O
performed. O
CT O
scan O
of O
the O
abdomen O
revealed O
significant O
adenopathy O
in O
the O
retroperitoneal O
space O
with O
a O
2.0 O
cm O
node O
between O
the O
IVC O
in O
aorta O
and O
a O
1.5 O
cm O
node O
just O
posterior O
to O
that, O
also O
a O
1.0 O
cm O
retrocrural O
node O
was O
seen. O
CT O
scan O
of O
the O
pelvis O
performed O
on O
the O
same O
day O
revealed O
a O
chain O
of O
retrocrural O
nodes O
in O
front O
of O
the O
aorta O
and O
vena O
cava O
extending O
to O
about O
2.0 O
to O
3.0 O
cm O
below O
the O
bifurcation O
as O
well O
as O
bulky O
adenopathy O
in O
the O
external O
iliac O
chain O
with O
an O
iliac O
mass O
measuring O
3.0 O
to O
3.5 O
cm O
in O
diameter O
on O
the O
left O
side. O
The O
largest O
node O
in O
the O
inguinal O
area O
measures O
approximately O
6.0 O
cm O
in O
diameter. O
The O
patient O
was O
then O
seen O
by O
Dr. O
Lopez O
on O
April O
12th O
who O
noted O
firm O
edema O
in O
the O
left O
leg O
and O
referred O
him O
to O
me O
for O
evaluation. O

as O
in O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Mr. O
Danny O
Nielson O
is O
a O
76-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
notable O
lymphadenopathy O
both O
by O
report O
from O
the O
outside O
hospital O
as O
well O
as O
by O
my O
initial O
evaluation O
of O
his O
CT O
scan O
from O
Mount O
Ascutney O
Hospital. O
This O
is O
very O
likely O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
lymphoma. O
I O
discussed O
lymphoma O
in O
general O
terms O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
son. O
I O
informed O
them O
that O
many O
lymphomas O
were O
treatable O
and O
some O
of O
them O
would O
indeed O
be O
curable. O
This O
would O
all O
depend O
on O
the O
exact O
histology O
that O
was O
revealed O
by O
biopsy. O
These O
sites O
of O
biopsy O
would O
be O
the O
left O
inguinal O
region. O
I O
informed O
them O
that O
the O
treatments O
that O
would O
be O
considered O
would O
include O
either O
antibodies, O
chemotherapy O
or O
radiation O
and O
these O
would O
depend O
significantly O
on O
the O
type O
of O
lymphoma O
that O
was O
found. O
The O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
no O
B O
symptoms O
and O
that O
he O
feels O
relatively O
well O
might O
indicate O
that O
this O
is O
a O
low-grade O
lymphoma. O
However, O
the O
relatively O
rapid O
onset O
of O
his O
leg O
swelling O
in O
the O
left O
leg O
may O
be O
more O
consistent O
with O
a O
higher-grade O
process. O
I O
feel O
that O
his O
left-sided O
edema O
is O
very O
likely O
due O
to O
decreased O
lymphatic O
drainage O
from O
the O
left O
leg. O
However, O
further O
discussion O
of O
his O
lymphoma O
will O
have O
to O
wait O
final O
pathology. O
I O
introduced O
the O
patient O
to O
Dr. O
Victor O
Ashley O
who O
is O
scheduled O
to O
perform O
a O
core O
needle O
lymph O
node O
biopsy O
later O
this O
afternoon. O
2. O
Cardiovascular: O
I O
am O
very O
concerned O
about O
the O
patient O
s O
history O
of O
intermittent O
burning O
chest O
pressure. O
If O
he O
will O
be O
diagnosed O
with O
an O
aggressive O
lymphoma O
and O
will O
need O
anthracycline, O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
have O
Cardiology O
on O
board. O
He O
has O
a O
significant O
murmur O
and O
his O
symptoma O
are O
suggestive O
of O
angina. O
The O
patient O
will O
be O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Square O
Turk O
later O
this O
week. O
In O
follow-up, O
Mr. O
Nielson O
will O
see O
me O
back O
in O
clinic O
next O
Sunday O
six O
days O
from O
now. O
At O
that O
point, O
we O
should O
have O
a O
firm O
and O
final O
biopsy O
report O
in O
hand O
and O
the O
staging O
studies O
also O
have O
been O
completed. O
At O
that O
point, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
discuss O
therapy O
in O
a O
meaningful O
way. O
The O
patient O
will O
call O
me O
back O
if O
problems O
arise O
in O
the O
meantime. O

HPI: O
Mr. O
Nielson O
was O
in O
his O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
until O
March O
of O
this O
year O
when O
he O
began O
noticing O
increasing O
swelling O
in O
his O
left O
leg O
over O
a O
period O
of O
three O
weeks. O
He O
also O
developed O
b/l O
groin O
swelling O
greater O
on O
the O
left; O
the O
swelling O
in O
the O
left O
groin O
was O
tender. O
He O
presented O
in O
early O
April O
where O
CT O
and O
PET O
scan O
of O
the O
pelvis O
and O
abdomen O
revealed O
a O
6.0 O
cm O
inguinal O
node, O
a O
chain O
of O
nodes O
in O
the O
retrocrural O
space, O
adenopathy O
in O
the O
external O
iliac O
chain O
(largest O
3.5 O
cm), O
and O
two O
nodes O
in O
the O
retroperitoneal O
space O
in O
between O
the O
IVC O
and O
aorta. O
He O
underwent O
biopsy O
of O
the O
left O
groin O
mass O
two O
weeks O
later O
revealing O
DLBCL O
confimed O
by O
immunophenotyping. O
Subsequent O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
revealed O
polyclonal O
B-cell O
populations O
and O
an O
inverted O
CD4/CD8 O
T O
Cell O
ratio, O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
monoclonal O
proliferation. O
The O
patient O
underwent O
his O
initial O
two O
cycles O
of O
CHOP O
in O
May, O
and O
experienced O
no O
adverse O
effects O
except O
for O
generalized O
weakness. O
PET O
exam O
in O
early O
June O
revealed O
larger O
left O
groin O
mass, O
improvement O
in O
lymphadenopathy, O
and O
a O
small O
pancreatic O
cystic O
lesion. O
It O
was O
undetermined O
whether O
this O
represented O
treatment O
effect O
or O
worsening O
of O
disease. O
The O
patient O
subsequently O
had O
his O
next O
two O
CHOP O
treatments O
in O
mid O
June O
and O
early O
July. O
PET O
scan O
and O
lymph O
node O
biopsy O
in O
early O
July O
revealed O
unchanged O
disease O
with O
evidence O
of O
fibrosis O
and O
inflammation. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
clinic O
by O
Dr. O
Quadri O
twice O
in O
July, O
with O
the O
second O
visit O
revealing O
increased O
PET O
avidity O
and O
persistence O
of O
the O
primary O
mass. O
Given O
the O
persistence O
of O
the O
mass O
and O
lack O
of O
response O
to O
CHOP, O
the O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Rodgers O
of O
the O
WDMC O
one O
week O
later O
on O
7/28 O
for O
consideration O
of O
auto-SCT O
vs O
more O
aggressive O
chemo O
regimen. O
Due O
to O
the O
patient's O
age O
and O
consideration O
of O
risk/benefit, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
best O
approach O
would O
be O
to O
attempt O
a O
more O
aggressive O
chemo O
regimen O
first. O
Mr. O
Nielson O
was O
admitted O
on O
8/2/2097 O
to O
receive O
his O
first O
cycle O
of O
R-ICE O
with O
dose-reduced O
Ifos O
and O
carboplatin O
becuase O
of O
h/o O
nephrectomy. O
He O
tolerated O
the O
treatment O
fairly O
well O
with O
some O
panycytopenia. O
Patient O
felt O
the O
R-ICE O
regimen O
was O
a O
little O
harder O
on O
him O
than O
the O
CHOP O
regimen. O
He O
felt O
effects O
including O
fatigue O
and O
constipation O
that O
resolved O
back O
to O
baseline O
in O
a O
few O
days. O
On O
8/9, O
he O
was O
given O
2 O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
cells O
due O
to O
anemia O
and O
on O
8/16, O
he O
was O
given O
a O
unit O
of O
pheresis O
platelets O
for O
his O
thrombocytopenia O
as O
well O
as O
two O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
for O
his O
anemia. O
He O
was O
initially O
scheduled O
to O
receive O
cycle O
2 O
of O
R-ICE O
on O
8/22 O
but O
that O
was O
delayed O
due O
to O
his O
thrombocytopenia. O
He O
says O
that O
he O
currently O
feels O
cold-intolerance O
and O
fatigue O
that O
is O
the O
same O
as O
when O
he O
first O
started O
his O
chemotherapy O
in O
May. O
He O

REASON O
FOR O
VISIT: O
Mr. O
Nielson O
is O
a O
77-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
Stage O
IIIB O
diffuse O
large O
B O
cell O
non-Hodgkin O
s O
lymphoma O
who O
is O
status O
post O
four O
cycles O
of O
CHOP-R O
chemotherapy O
with O
persistent O
disease O
(documented O
by O
PET O
and O
biopsy). O
He O
underwent O
salvage O
with O
two O
cycles O
of O
R-ICE O
and O
unfortunately O
continued O
to O
have O
PET O
avidity O
in O
the O
area. O
As O
a O
result, O
we O
scheduled O
him O
to O
begin O
therapy O
with O
Zevalin O
next O
Monday. O
He O
is O
here O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
physical O
and O
count O
check O
to O
make O
sure O
he O
has O
adequate O
platelets O
for O
this O
immunotherapy. O
INTERVAL O
HISTORY: O
He O
describes O
an O
episode O
approximately O
one O
week O
ago O
of O
sudden O
onset O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
tightness O
in O
his O
chest. O
He O
sat O
down O
for O
approximately O
10 O
minutes, O
it O
resolved, O
and O
has O
not O
recurred O
since O
then. O
However, O
we O
also O
have O
the O
reports O
of O
a O
follow O
up O
PET/CT O
scan O
which O
was O
performed O
yesterday O
which O
show O
a O
new O
accumulation O
of O
bilateral O
pleural O
effusions O
which O
the O
radiologist O
feels O
are O
most O
consistent O
with O
heart O
failure. O
In O
addition, O
the O
scans O
also O
showe O
the O
prior O
area O
of O
PET O
avidity O
in O
the O
leg O
continues, O

This O
area O
is O

Mr. O

about O
this. O
In O
addition, O
we O
also O
have O
results O
from O
laboratories O
today O
which O
show O
his O
platelets O
at O
88,000, O

he O
is O

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: O
Given O
his O
current O
status, O
we O
have O
decided O
to O
transfer O
him O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
today O
for O
further O
evaluation O
of O
his O
cardiac O
symptoms, O
particularly O
to O
rule O
out O
myocardial O
infarction O
and O
assess O
whether O
he O
is, O
indeed, O
in O
new O
heart O
failure O
We O
attempted O
to O
contact O
cardiology O
for O
an O
outpatient O
evaluation, O
but O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
do O
so.Therefore, O
he O
will O
be O
transported O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
for O
an O
emergent O
workup O
of O
his O
new O
symptoms. O
I O
suspect O
he O
will O
be O
admitted. O
Hopefully, O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get O
his O
cardiac O
issues O
under O
control. O
Unfortunately, O
from O
an O
oncologic O
point O
of O
view, O
it O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
his O
platelet O
count O
will O
reach O
at O
least O
100,000 O
in O
order O
to O
give O
this O
man O
therapy. O
As O
a O
potential O
other O
therapy, O
we O
will O
discuss O
the O
ability O
of O
radiation O
oncology O
to O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
cGy O
to O
that O
local O
area O
considering O
he O
only O
received O

at O
the O
onset. O

four O
months O
of O
worsening O
pain, O
paresthesias, O
and O
'numbness' O
on O
the O
right O
worse O
than O
left O

This O
is O
worse O
at O
night O
and O
does O
occasionally O
wake O
him O
up O
from O
sleep. O
Also O
bothers O
him O
during O
prolonged O
activity. O
He O
also O
reports O
recently O
over O
the O
past O
few O
months O
noting O
difficulty O
with O
the O
key O
pinch, O

demonstrating O
findings O
significant O
for O
severe O

On O

today, O
he O
is O
very O

well O
appearing O
in O
no O
apparent O

Examination O
of O
the O

There O
is O
no O

IMPRESSION: O
The O
patient O
is O
seen O
and O
examined O
with O
Dr. O
Santiago. O
At O
this O
time, O
we O
feel O
that O
Larry O
has O
indeed O
a O
significant, O
right O
worse O
than O
left, O
bilateral O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome. O
Given O
the O
amount O
of O
weakness O
and O
thenar O
wasting, O
he O
has O
difficulty O
with O
abductor O
pollicis, O
we O
have O
recommended O
proceeding O
with O
both O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
as O
well O
as O
possible O
FTS O
of O
ring O
finger O
to O

We O
discussed O
with O
Larry O
the O
risks O
and O
benefits O
of O
this O
procedure O
and O
he O
is O
in O
agreement O
of O
the O
plan. O
We O
will O
try O
to O
schedule O
him O
to O
proceed O
with O
surgery O
at O
some O
point O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
We O
filled O
out O
both O
history O
and O
physical, O
as O
well O
as O

today O
in O

History O
of O
present O
illness O
The O
patient O
has O
done O
very O
well O
over O
the O
last O
year. O
He O
has O
maintained O
his O
weight, O
which O
has O
been O
quite O
difficult O
given O
the O
social O
commitments O
that O
he O
has. O
He O
is O
requiring O
to O
eat O
out O
quite O
a O
bit. O
He O
has O
also O
done O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
traveling O
over O
the O
last O
three O
to O
four O
months. O
This O
caused O
him O
to O
be O
more O

than O

His O

has O
stood O
up. O
He O
has O
some O
discomfort O
occasionally O
in O
that O
area, O
but O
for O
the O

feels O
that O
this O
is O

in O
October O
of O
this O

Though O
you O
know O
her O

well, O
I O
will O
recount O
it O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O

Ms. O
Yerger O

Her O

use. I-SMOKER
Her O
father O
died O
of O
a O
myocardial O

at O
age O
60. O
On O
physical O
exam, O
Ms. O
Yerger O
looks O
extremely O
well O
today. O
She O
is O
comfortable O
seated O
on O
the O
exam O
table. O
Her O
skin O
is O
warm O
and O
dry. O
She O
has O
a O
diffuse O
erythematous O
macular O
papular O
rash O
predominantly O
on O
her O
extremities. O
Her B-HYPERTENSION
blood I-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
is I-HYPERTENSION
140/80, I-HYPERTENSION
her O
heart O
rate O
is O
in O
the O
70's. O
She O
has O
no O
jugular O
venous O
distention. O
Her O
carotids O
are O
2+ O
without O
bruits. O
Her O
chest O
reveals O
decreased O
breath O
sounds O
at O
the O
left O
base. O
There O
are O
no O
crackles O
or O
wheezes. O
Cardiac O
exam O
reveals O
a O
nondisplaced O
PMI O
with O
regular O
rate O
and O
rhythm, O
S1, O
S2 O
and O
S4 O
is O
present O
and O
P2 O
is O
slightly O
increased. O
There O
was O
a O
grade O
II/VI O
holosystolic O
murmur O
radiating O
toward O
the O
apex. O
Her O
abdomen O
is O
soft O
and O
nontender. O
Her O
extremities O
are O
free O
of O
cyanosis O
or O
clubbing. O
Distal O
pulses O
are O
1+. O
She O
has O
mild O
edema O
of O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity. O
Her O
ECG O
reveals O
sinus O
rhythm O
79 O
beats O
per O
minute, O
normal O
axis O
and O
intervals, O
persistent O
deep O
anterior O
T O
wave O
inversions. O
Overall, O
Ms. O
Yerger O
continues O
on O
a O
steady O
course O
of O
recovery O
after O
her O
non-ST B-CAD
elevation I-CAD
MI I-CAD
and I-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
bypass I-CAD
grafting I-CAD
in O
mid O
October. O
Her O
persistent O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
may O
be O
related O
to O
persistent O
pleural O
effusion. O
We O
will O
reevaluate O
today O
with O
a O
repeat O
chest O
x-ray. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
think O
that O
we O
should O
continue O
her O
oral O
diuretic O
regimen. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
her O
persistent O
rash O
is O
related O
to O
her O
Lasix. O
Although O
not O
certain O
to O
be O
successful, O
we O
have O
made O
a O
change O
to O
Bumex O
1 O
mg O
po O
q. O
day O
today O
in O
the O
hopes O
that O
if O
Lasix O
is O
responsible O
for O
her O
rash O
this O
may O
resolve. O
I O
have O
made O
no O
other O
changes O
to O
her O
medical O
regimen. O
We O
will O
continue O
aspirin, O
beta O
blockade, O
ACE O
inhibition O
and O
statin O
for O
secondary O
prevention. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
seeing O
her O
again O
in O
approximately O
eight O
to O
twelve O
weeks. O
In O
addition, O
she O
will O
follow- O
up O
with O
Dr. O
Abreu O
for O
possible O
thoracentesis O
if O
she O
has O
a O
persistent O
pleural O
effusion O
that O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
her O
symptoms. O

now O
s/p O
I&D O
of O
the O
open O
medial O
malleolus O
wound; O
we O
were O
consulted O
by O
Dr. O
Felton O
for O
recommendations O
on O
antibiotic O
management. O
The O
extent O
of O
infection O
is O
a O
surgical O
diagnosis. O
If O
the O
swabs O
were O
obtained O
from O
the O
superficial O
wound, O
then O
this O
may O
represent O
merely O
a O
wound O
infection O
which O
requires O
2 O
weeks O
of O
antibiotics. O
However O
if O
the O
infection O
was O
felt O
on O
surgical O
inspection O
to O
extend O
to O
the O
region O
of O
the O
removed O
hardware, O
then O
this O
represents O
osteomyelitis O
by O
definition, O
and O
she O
will O
need O
6 O
weeks O
of O
IV O
antibiotics O
with O
consideration O
of O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
remaining O
hardware. O
After O
discussion O
with O
the O
ortho O
resident, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
culture O
was O
obtained O
from O
the O
site O
of O
screw O
removal. O
Thus, O
we O
have O
to O
assume O
hardware O
infection O
with O
concomitant O
osteomyelitis. O
Thus O
6 O
weeks O
of O
IV O
antibiotics O
is O
necessary. O
We O
cannot O
rule O
out O
infection O
of O
the O
remaining O
hardware, O
however O
I O
understand O
the O
reluctance O
to O
remove O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
hardware O
by O
the O
ortho O
service. O
Thus O
would O
pursue O
6 O
week O
course O
of O
therapy, O
then O
monitor O
closely O
for O
signs O
of O
failure. O
1. O
Continue O

until O

are O
available; O
will O

whether O

in O

given O
retained O
hardware O
based O
on O
susceptibility O
results O

History: O
Patient O
is O
a O
72 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
began O
having O
dysphagia O
about O
4 O
weeks O
ago. O
On O
8/01/83 O
he O
was O
scheduled O
for O
a O
Colonoscopy, O
so O
his O
PCP O
suggested O
he O
have O
an O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
The O
Colonoscopy O
demonstrated O
Diverticulosis O
and O
the O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
demonstrated O
a O
partially O
obstructing O
esophageal/gastric O
cardia O
tumor O
which O
was O
biopsied. O
Pathology O
revealed O
moderately O
to O
poorly O
differentiated O
adenocarcinoma. O
On O
8/10/83 O
an O
Abd O
and O
Pelvic O
CT O
were O
done O
showing: O
marked O
thickening O
of O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
distal O
esophagus O
(35-40cm O
by O
endoscopy O
- O
partial O
obstruction O
and O
circumferential) O
extending O
into O
the O
gastric O
cardia, O
consistent O
with O
biopsy O
proven O
adenocarcinoma. O
Also O
felt O
to O
be O
bleeding O
silently O
so O
placed O
on O
Fe O
replacement. O
Also, O
enlarged O
gastroepiploic, O
celiac O
and O
aortocaval O
lymph O
nodes O
consistent O
with O
metastatic O
disease. O
On O
8/10/83 O
a O
Chest O
CT O
revealed O
thickening O
of O
the O
lower O
esophagus O
extending O
into O
the O
chest O
esophageal O
junction. O
This O
is O

with O
lymphadenopathy O
in O
the O
(L) O
axilla, O
gastrohepatic O
ligament, O
celiac O
axis O
and O
retrocrural O

The O
appearance O
is O
highly O
suspicious O
for O
esophageal O

The O

with O

He O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
Given O
the O
fairly O
asymptomatic O
nature O
of O
his O
cancer O
we O
have O
opted O
to O
start O
with O
radiation O
first, O
as O
his O
primary O
mass O
is O
fungating O
in O
nature O
and O
there O
has O
been O
evidence O
of O
blood O
loss. O
After O
radiation O
is O
completed O
in O
3-4 O
weeks, O
I O
will O
see O
him O
for O
consideration O
of O
chemotherapy O
but O
only O
after O
re-staging. O
If O
he O
remains O
asymptomatic O
and O
there O
has O
been O
little O
progression O
of O
disease, O
we O
may O
opt O
to O
observe O
him O
closely O
without O
treatment. O
If O
the O
scans O
show O
significant O
progression O
or O
he O
becomes O
symptomatic, O
then O
we O
will O
start O
systemic O
treatment O
soon O
afterwards. O
He O
is O
not O
a O
surgical O
candidate O
given O
his O
stage O
of O
disease O
and O
lack O
of O
symptoms. O
RTC O

headache, O
and O
nausea O
without O

He O
denied O
any O
chills, O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
chest O

palpitations, O
or O
pain O
upon O
deep O
breathing. O
That O
evening, O
two O
nights O
prior O
to O
admission, O
he O
developed O
night O

but O
had O
no O
rigors. O
He O
continued O
to O
feel O
similarly O
throughout O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
admission, O
and O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
for O
further O
evaluation. O
The O
current O
presentation O
is O
in O
the O
context O
of O
increasingly O
poor O
PO O
intake O
secondary O
to O
chemotherapy O
and O
treatment O
for O
esophageal O
cancer. O
He O
reports O
a O
four-to-five O

of O
poor O
appetite, O
eating O
chicken O

He O
denies O
any O

the O
day O
prior O

he O
was O
NPO O
for O
a O

History O
(per O
attending O
notes) O
Patient O
is O
a O
72 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
began O
having O
dysphagia O
6/83. O
On O
8/01/83 O
he O
was O
scheduled O
for O
a O
Colonoscopy, O
so O
his O
PCP O
suggested O
he O
have O
an O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
The O
Colonoscopy O
demonstrated O
Diverticulosis O
and O
the O
UGI O
Endoscopy O
demonstrated O
a O
partially O
obstructing O
esophageal/gastric O
cardia O
tumor O
which O
was O
biopsied. O
Pathology O
revealed O
moderately O
to O
poorly O
differentiated O
adenocarcinoma. O
On O
8/10/83 O
an O
Abd O
and O
Pelvic O
CT O
were O
done O
showing: O
marked O
thickening O
of O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
distal O
esophagus O
(35-40cm O
by O
endoscopy O
- O
partial O
obstruction O
and O
circumferential) O
extending O
into O
the O
gastric O
cardia, O
consistent O
with O
biopsy O
proven O
adenocarcinoma. O
Also O
felt O
to O
be O
bleeding O
silently O
so O
placed O
on O
Fe O
replacement. O
Also, O
enlarged O
gastroepiploic, O
celiac O
and O
aortocaval O
lymph O
nodes O
consistent O
with O
metastatic O
disease. O
On O
8/10/83 O
a O
Chest O
CT O
revealed O
thickening O
of O
the O
lower O
esophagus O
extending O
into O
the O
chest O
esophageal O
junction. O
This O
is O
associated O
with O
lymphadenopathy O
in O
the O
(L) O
axilla, O
gastrohepatic O
ligament, O
celiac O
axis O
and O
retrocrural O
space. O
The O
appearance O
is O
highly O
suspicious O
for O
esophageal O
cancer O
and O
nodal O
spread. O
There O
is O
a O
3mm O
nodule O
adjacent O
to O
the O
(R) O
major O
fissure O
in O
the O
lung. O
PET O
scan O
confirmed O
axillary O
and O
abdominal O
involvement O
with O
cancer. O
The O
lung O
nodule O
was O
too O
small O
for O
PET O
to O
evaluate. O

1. O
Pneumonia: O
The O
patient O
presents O
with O
a O
two-day O
history O
of O
dizziness, O
subjective O
fevers, O
and O
productive O
cough O
of O
green O
sputum. O
Physical O
exam O
reveals O
decreased O
bibasilar O
breath O
sounds, O
right O
greater O
than O
left. O
The O
constellation O
of O
symptoms O
can O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
pneumonia O
found O
on O
chest O
imaging. O
The O
possible O
causes O
of O
the O
pneumonia O
include O
aspiration, O
infectious, O
and O
post-obstructive O
causes. O
The O
patient O
reports O
no O
problems O
with O
swallowing O
and O
has O
not O
vomited, O
making O
aspiration O
pneumonia O
lower O
on O
the O
differential. O
The O
chest O
CT O
does O
not O
show O
any O
evidence O
of O
tumor O
obstruction O
around O
the O
bronchi. O
Further, O
the O
pneumonia O
and O
pleural O
effusions O
are O
bilateral, O
meaning O
that O
the O
obstruction O
would O
have O
to O
be O
higher O
in O
the O
bronchial O
tree, O
making O
obstruction O
less O
likely. O
In O
this O
case O
the O
most O
likely O
cause O
is O
infectious O
in O
nature; O
the O
agents O
most O
likely O
to O
cause O
pneumonia O
in O
this O
patient O
are O
the O
typical O
bacteria, O
such O
as O
pneumococcus, O
H. O
influenza, O
Staphalococcus, O
and O
other O
gram-negative O
bugs, O
atypical O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Legionella O
sp, O
Mycoplasma O

and O
Chlamydia O

and O
viral O
causes. O
Based O
upon O

2. O
Dizziness: O
The O
patient O
presents O
with O
a O
two-day O
history O
of O
dizziness. O
Potential O
causes O
include O
orthostatic O
causes O
secondary O
to O
hypotension, O
dehydration, O
or O
poor O
sympthathetic O
tone; O
anxiety; O
cardiac O
causes O
(dysrhythmias, O
CAD), O
anemia, O
and O
electrolyte O
abnormalities O
(e.g. O
hypoglycemia). O
This O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
CAD, O
but O
EKG O
findings O
and O
cardiac O
enzymes O
do O
not O
suggest O
cardiac O
insult. O
The O
patient O
has O
not O
had O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
BUN O
or O
creatinine O
from O
baseline, O
making O
dehydration O
less O
likely. O
Labs O
did O
not O
show O
any O
electrolyte O
abnormalities; O
therefore O
hypoglycemia O
is O
low O
on O
the O
differential O
diagnosis. O
The O
dizziness O
was O
positional O
in O
nature. O
The O
patient O
reports O
long-standing O
poor O
PO O
intake, O
particularly O
because O
he O
was O
NPO O
for O
much O
of O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
the O
start O
of O
symptoms. O
In O
this O
patient, O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
dizziness O
is O
most O
likely O
orthostatic O
in O
nature, O
secondary O
to O
poor O
PO O
intake O
and O
decreased O
sympathetic O
tone. O
a. O

In O

Dear O
Dr. O

Mrs. O

for O
followup. O
Currently, O
she O
complains O
of O
exertional O
fatigue, O
exertional O
dyspnea, O
and O
mild O

Since O

it O
quite O
difficult O
to O

and O
has O
thus O

declined O

As O
you O
know, O
in O
the O

she O
also O
has O
declined O
any O
consideration O
of O
attempted O

Impression: O
Mrs. O
Joshy O
continues O
to O
suffer O
from O
morbid B-OBESE
obesity, I-OBESE
and O
I O
had O
a O
long O
discussion O
with O
her O
and O
her O
daughter O
regarding O
the O
essential O
nature O
of O
her O
engaging O
in O
an O
aggressive O
weigh O
reduction O
program. O
I O
once O
again O
have O
strongly O
encouraged O
her O
to O
make O
an O
appointment O
with O
our O
obesity O
clinic O
to O
assist O
in O
extensive O
weight O
reduction. O
I O
also O
discussed O
with O
her O
my O
concerns O
regarding O
her O
symptoms O
of O
slowly O
progressive O
peripheral O
edema, O
particularly O
as O
it O
pertains O
both O
to O
her O
weight, O
and O
atrial O
or O
tachyarrhythmias. O
As O
in O
the O
past, O
she O
told O
me O
that O
she O
would O
refuse O
any O
consideration O
for O
attempted O
cardioversion O
or O
other O
studies. O
She O
did, O
however, O
agree O
to O
continue O
with O
her O
current O
medical O
regimen. O
I O
obtained O
routine O
blood O
studies O
today O
to O
verify O
the O
adequacy O
of O
her O
lipid O
control O
and O
diabetes O
management. O
I O
have O
introduced O
her O
to O
Hayden O
Nutter, O
her O
nurse O
practitioner, O
who O
will O
assist O
in O
trying O
to O
achieve O
a O
little O
more O
diuresis O
overt O
he O
next O
few O
weeks. O
We O
have O
given O
her O
a O
prescription O
for O
Zaroxylyn O
to O
begin O
at O
2.5 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d., O
which O
will O
help O
result O
in O
some O
degree O
of O
mild O
diuresis. O
Nonetheless, O
she O
understands O
that O
significant O
weight O
loss O
can O
only O
occur O
through O
a O
weight O
reduction O
program. O
I O
have O
of O
course O
explained O
to O
her O
the O
increased O
cardiac O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
her O
current O
lifestyle. O
Beyond O
this, O
I O
have O
not O
altered O
her O
current O
medical O
regimen. O
Of O
course, O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O
his O
care. O
Sincerely O
yours, O

The O
patient O
is O
unable O
to O
say O
when O
she O
specifically O
noted O
her O
lower O
extremity O
swelling. O
She O
states O
that O
approximately O
1 O
year O
prior O
to O
arrival O
she O
had O
to O
throw O
out O
all O
of O
her O
shoes O
except O
for O
2 O
pairs O
because O
all O
those O
shoes O
had O
become O
tight. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
the O
patient O
is O
only O
able O
to O
wear O
sandals O
and O
apparently O
her O
co-workers O
noted O
her O
to O
be O
significantly O
swollen O
and O
suggested O
that O
she O
see O
a O
physician. O
The O
patient O
states O
that O
there O
was O
no O
acute O
change O
in O
her O
swelling O
today. O
She O
states O
that O
she O
has O
had O
a O
cough O
for O
1 O
month. O
Again, O
there O
was O
no O
acute O
change. O
Today, O
she O
denies O
any O
chest O

Dear O
Dr. O
Taylor: O
Mrs. O
Joshi O
returns O
to O
the O
office O
for O
routine O
followup. O
Since O
last O
seen, O
she O
apparently O
was O
without O
evidence O
of O
increasing O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
was O
advised O
to O
transiently O
hold O
both O
her O
lisinopril B-MEDICATION
and O
Zaroxolyn. O
By O
doing O
so, O
her O
creatinine O
fell O
from O
2.2 O
to O
1.6 O
and O
BUN O
from O
117 O
to O
57. O
She O
subsequently O
has O
resumed O
her O
lisinopril O
therapy, O
as O
apparently O
her O
blood O
pressure O
increased O
off O
her O
ACE O
inhibitor. O
In O
addition, O
as O
part O
of O
her O
followup O
last O
March, O
she O
underwent O
an O
adenosine O
MIBI O
stress O
test O
during O
which O
time O
she O
achieved O
a O
peak O
heart O
rate O
of O
65, O
peak O
blood O
pressure O
of O
129/50, O
stopping O
because O
she O
reached O
the O
end O
of O
the O
adenosine O
infusion O
protocol. O
Her O
gated O
SPECT O
imaging O
demonstrated O
a O
global O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
38% O
with O
a O
mildly O
dilated O
left O
ventricle O
and O
akinesis O
of O
the O
basal O
inferoseptal O
and O
entire O
inferior O
wall. O
Her O
rest-stress O
perfusion O
imaging O
showed O
similarly O
a O
large O
fixed O
perfusion O
defect O
in O
the O
inferior O
and O
basal O
inferoseptal O
wall O
without O
any O
area O
of O
reversible O
ischemia. O
Her O
last O
echocardiogram O

The O

Impression: O
Ms. O
Joshi O
remains O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
perspective, O
however, O
I O
am O
obviously O
concerned O
about O
her O
potential O
for O
lightheadedness O
in O
light O
of O
her O
bradycardia. O
I O
have O
asked O
her O
to O
decrease O
her O
Toprol-XL O
to O
25 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily O
and O
to O
repeat O
an O
EKG O
four O
to O
five O
days O
after O
doing O
so. O
I O
of O
course O
have O
reminded O
her O
as O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
getting O
in O
contact O
with O
you O
or O
myself O
straight O
away O
should O
she O
develop O
any O
symptoms O
suggestive O
of O
lightheadedness O
or O
dizziness. O
She O
understands O
that O
she O
may O
require O
a O
permanent O
pacemaker O
in O
the O
future. O
Most O
recent O
blood O
studies O
show O
a O
significantly O
elevated O
glucose O
of O
183 O
(she O
states O
she O
is O
trying O
to O
tailor O
her O
insulin O
regimen O
with O
you) O
and O
in O

except O
for O
an O
alkaline O

of O

and O

for O
a O
cholesterol O
of O
134, O
triglyceride O
of O
74, O
HDL O
58, O
and O
LDL O
61. O
She O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
continuing O
to O
adhere O
to O
a O
low-saturated O
fat, O
low-cholesterol O
diet O
while O
remaining O
on O
her O
antilipemic O
therapy. O
She O
will O
discuss O
with O
you O
and O
her O
nephrologist O
the O
optimal O
management O
of O
her O
mild O
renal O
insufficiency. O
In O
light O
of O
both O
her O
diabetes O
and O
coronary O
disease, O
it O
certainly O
would O
be O
optimal O
if O
possible O
to O
continue O
her O
on O
her O
ACE O
inhibitor. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
she O
does O
not O
meet O
criteria O
for O
prophylactic O
placement O
of O
an O
AICD O
and O
her O
New O
York O
Heart O
Association O
class O
I O
to O
II O
status O
precludes O
the O
need O
for O
consideration O
of O
biventricular O
pacing. O
Other O
than O
reducing O
her O
beta-blocker O
regimen O
as O
described O
above, O
I O
have O
not O
further O
altered O
her O
current O
medical O
program. O
I O
thank O
you O
very O
much O

DEPARTMENT O

Given O

be O
cardiac, O
given O

she O
did O
not O

but O
simply O
had O
trouble O
articulating O
herself. O
In O
particular O
she O
related O
several O
examples O
of O
semantic O
paraphasic O
errors. O
The O
episode O
came O
on O
suddenly O
and O
lasted O
1-2 O

likely O
to O
represent O

given O
clinical O
presentation O
and O
after O
largely O

work-up. O
Since O
discharge, O
she O
has O
continued O
to O
have O
her O
baseline O
migraines O
at O
a O
frequency O
of O
~ O
2x/month. O
At O
this O
point, O
we O
would O
not O
recommend O
beginning O
prophylactic O
therapy, O
but O
would O
consider O
doing O
so O
if O
attacks O
become O
more O
frequent. O
Given O
her O
clinical O
response O
to O
Excedrin O
migraine, O
we O
have O
suggested O
continuing O
this O
drug O
for O
abortive O
therapy, O
but O
have O
spoken O
at O
length O
about O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
rebound O

and O
cautioned O
her O
about O
using O
it O
more O
than O
once O
every O
10-14 O
days. O
We O
have O
discussed O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
complex O
migraine O
and O
reinforced O
the O
inherent O
difficulties O
of O
distinguishing O
these O
attacks O
from O
TIA/stroke; O
thus O
we O
have O
urged O
to O
continue O
to O
take O
unusual O
non-stereotyped O
deficits O
seriously. O
She O
will O
follow-up O
with O
us O
in O
4-6 O

if O
the O
need O
arises. O
Thank O
you O

allowing O

We O

and O
chest O
pain. O
Her O
chest O
CT O
showed O
an O
interstitial O
pattern O
and O
a O
patulous O
esophagus; O
the O
interstitial O
lung O
disease O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
in O
part O
due O
to O
the O
mixed O
connective O
tissue O
disease O
and O
in O
part O
due O
to O
aspiration. O
She O
was O
also O
noted O
at O
that O
time O
to O
have O
an O
ANA O
1:2560 O
speckled O
with O
positive O
RNP, O
negative O
Scl-70. O
Clinically, O
she O
had O
Sjogren's O
with O
sclerodermatous O
changes O
to O
her O
hands O
and O
telangiectasias O
across O
her O
face. O
The O
Raynaud's O
was O
exacerbated O
by O
the O
extensive O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
she O
had O
to O
undergo O
stenting B-CAD
of O
the O
right O
common O
femoral O
artery O
11/2095. O
Slowly O
these O
lesions O
healed. O
Interim O
Issues: O
The O
diabetes B-DIABETES
and O
hypertension O
slowly O
became O
well O
controlled. O
But B-CAD
on I-CAD

tolerance I-CAD
test, I-CAD
she I-CAD
presented I-CAD
with I-CAD
significant B-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
and I-CAD
was I-CAD
noted I-CAD
to I-CAD
have I-CAD
significant I-CAD
aortic I-CAD
stenosis. I-CAD
In B-CAD
April I-CAD
2097 I-CAD
she I-CAD
underwent I-CAD
stenting I-CAD
and I-CAD
she I-CAD
had I-CAD
a I-CAD
prosthetic I-CAD
aortic I-CAD
valve I-CAD
placed. I-CAD
Recovering I-CAD
from I-CAD
surgery I-CAD
has I-CAD
been I-CAD
slow. I-CAD
But O
it O
has O
been O
steady O
and O
uncomplicated. O
She O
can O
now O
go O
up O
2 O
flights O
of O
stairs, O
then O
rest O
to O
go O
the O
third O
flight O
to O
her O
home. O
She O
has O
had O
no O
recurrent O
chest O
pain. O
She O
keeps O
her O
hands O
and O
feet O
warm O
and O
has O
had O
no O
tissue O
damage. O
She O
feels O
a O
little O
tightness O
in O
the O
chest O
wall O
in O
taking O
a O
deep O
breath O
(points O
anteriorly), O
but O
no O
dyspnea O
per O
se. O
She O
healed O
well O
postoperatively. O
She O
has O
recently O
been O
seen O
by O
cardiology O
and O
Dr. O
Nichols O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
in O
good O
shape. O
Her O
medications O
were O
reviewed O
and O
updated O
in O
the O
LMR. O
In O
terms O
of O
the O
MCTD, O
she O
continues O
to O
have O
some O
Raynaud's. O
She O
tries O
to O
keep O
her O
hands O
warm O
and O
she O
has O
had O
little O
breakdown O
of O
the O
tissue O
but O
rather O
thickening O
of O
her O
hands. O
What O
troubles O
her O
most O
is O
the O
intermittent O
synovitis. O
She O
felt O
much O
better O
on O
5 O
mg O
of O
prednisone O
daily. O
She O
remains O
on O
Plaquenil O
200 O

She O
has O
had O
no O

She O
has O
had O
no O

of O
Dr. O

was O
seen O
because O
Dr. O
Bridges O
was O
called O
away O
on O
an O
emergency O
basis. O
His O
major O
concern O
is O
results O
of O
recent O
vascular O
studies. O
He O
has O
known O
diabetes B-DIABETES
and O
has O
a O
history O
of O
several O
years O
of O
exertional O
cramping O
and O
discomfort O
in O
his O
legs. O
This O
occurs O
only O
with O
heavy O
exertion. O
Dr. O
Bridges O
documented O
normal O
pedal O

the O
last O
visit. O
His O
recent O
vascular O
studies O
showed O
no O
significant O
drop O
off O

pressures O
level O
of O
the O
ankle. O
Did O
given O
his O
history O
a O
more O
inclined O
to O
suspect O
this O
might O
be O
pseudoclaudication O
due O
to O
neuropathy O
or O
spinal O
stenosis. O
He O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
Dr. O

about O

he O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
This O
is O
an O
elderly O
patient, O
82, O
with O
known O
diabetes B-DIABETES
and O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
which O
has O
required O
placement O
of O
a O
pacemaker. O
I O
last O
saw O
his O
blood O
sugar O
and O
it O
was O
276 O
and O
his B-DIABETES
A1c B-DIABETES
in I-DIABETES
October I-DIABETES
was I-DIABETES
7. I-DIABETES
So, O
I O
had O
him O
back O
today O
to O
discuss O
diabetic O
management O
and O
also O
review O
his O
general O
health O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
diabetes O
and O
his O
other O
medications. O
We O
went O
over O
his O
medications O
to O
start O
with O
and O
he O
is O
taking O
them O
exactly O
as O
it O
was O
shown O
in O
the O
computer. O
These O
include O
atenolol B-MEDICATION
25, O
Glucotrol B-MEDICATION

twice O
a O
day, O
Actos B-MEDICATION
45, O
Lipitor B-MEDICATION

Lasix O

a O

and O
Procardia B-MEDICATION
XL O
60 O
mg O
q.d., O
and O
Coumadin. O
He O
is O
followed O
by O
Dr. O
Itzel O
Jaimes O
for O
his O
cardiac O
problems O
and O
by O
a O
diabetologist O
at O
the O
Claiborne O
for O
managing O
his O
diabetes. O
He O
had O
no O
other O
complaints. O
His O
bowel O
movements O
are O
regular. O
He O
still O
has O
nocturia O
x3 O
and O
was O
recently O
seen O
by O
a O
urologist O
who O
felt O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
any O
intervention. O
He O
otherwise O
was O
in O
good O
spirits O
and O
has O
no O
immediate O
complaints. O
His O
social O
situation, O
his O
allergies O
and O
and O
his O
family O
history O
and O
past O
medical O
history, O
are O
overall O
as O
previously O
recorded. O
There O
are O
no O
other O
pertinent O
findings O
in O
the O
review O
of O
systems. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
His B-HYPERTENSION
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
140/60. I-HYPERTENSION
He O
looks O
well. O
I O
did O
not O
measure O
his O
weight. O
His O
heart O
rate O
was O
around O
64-68. O
His O
pupils O
are O
equal O
and O
reactive O
to O
light O
and O
extraocular O
movements O
were O
full. O
Mucous O
membranes O
of O
the O
mouth O
and O
tongue O
were O
normal. O
Lungs O
were O
clear O
to O
percussion O
and O
auscultation. O
Cardiac O
exam O
showed O
regular O
sinus O
rhythm, O
a O
normal O
S2 O
and O
no O
significant O
murmurs. O
Liver O
and O
spleen O
were O
not O
palpable. O
He O
had O
only O
1+ O
peripheral O
edema O
which O
is O
less O
than O
usual. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
He O
seems O
stable, O
I O
think O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
regulation O
of O
diabetes O
and O
I O
have O
asked O
him O
to O
get O
a O
hemoglobin O
A1c O
and O
to O
measure O
his O
blood O
sugar O
when O
he O
gets O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
in O
the O
afternoon O
before O
he O
has O
supper. O
He O
will O
come O
back O
to O
see O
me O
in O
about O
a O
month's O
time O
to O
follow O
up O
on O
these O
issues. O

VISIT O
(CHC) O
The O
patient O
is O
seen O
in O
followup O
at O
the O
Community O
Health. O
He O
came O
back O
from O
Pennsylvania O
after O
being O
there O
about O
a O
month. O
He O
has O
had O
an O
eventful O
past O
six O
months. O
In O
October, O
he O
apparently O
had O
a O
TIA O
or O
small O
stroke. O
He O
was O
evaluated O
with O
an O
MRA O
of O
his O
neck O
and O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
blockage O
to O
warrant O
surgery. O
His O
symptomatology O
fortunately O
clear. O
His O
symptoms O
were O
related O
to O
loss O
of O
feeling O
in O
his O
right O
upper O
extremity. O
About O
this O
time, O
he O
also O
developed O
a O
traumatic O
lesion O
of O
the O
left O
second O
toe. O
He O
apparently O
develops O
some O
cellulitis O
and O
was O
treated O
with O
ampicillin. O
Not O
long O
after O
this, O
he O
went O
into O
renal O
failure. O
He O
was O
told O
that O
they O
could O
not O
tell O
if O
that O
was O
due O
to O
the O
antibiotics O
or O
the O
gadolinium. O
According O
to O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
wife, O
his O
creatinine O
went O
as O
high O
as O
9. O
Fortunately, O
it O
is O
currently O
back O
down O
to O
2.4. O
His O
toe O
lesion O
has O
been O
very O
slow O
to O
improve. O
He O
describes O
pain O
in O
the O
toe O
and O
often O
has O
to O
sleep O
in O
a O
chair O
with O
his O
foot O
dependent. O
He O
has O
seen O
various O
physicians O
and O
podiatrists O
in O
Pennsylvania, O
without O
much O
improvement. O
They O
finally O
told O
him, O
he O
would O
do O
well O
to O
come O
back O
here O
for O
further O
care O
and O
evaluation. O
On O

today, O
I O
can O
feel O
femoral O
and O
popiteal O
pulses. O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
any O

ABI O
is O
good, O
although O
his O
diabetic O
calcinosis O
probably O
makes O
this O
unreliable. O
He O
has O
some O
slight O
pulsatile O
flow O
at O
the O
right O
toe O
level O
and O
flat O
tracings O
at O
left O
toes. O
He O
has O
1 O
cm O
escharover O
the O
dorsum O
of O
his O
second O
toe. O
There O
is O
some O
erythema O
of O
the O
toe O
and O
proximal O
dorsal O
forefoot. O
This O
certainly O
has O
the O
appearance O
of O
some O
cellulites. O
There O
is O
minimal O
to O
no O
swelling O
of O
the O
toe. O
We O
will O
place O
him O
on O
Keflex O
250 O
mg O
q.i.d. O
for O
7 O
to O
10 O
days O
to O
see O
if O
this O
helps O
with O
any O
possible O
associated O
cellulitis. O
I O
will O
refer O
him O
to O
Dr. O
Caldwell O
for O
recommendations O
regarding O
wound O
quick O
care O
and O
an O
opinion O
whether O
or O
not O
hyperbaric O

therapy O
might O
be O
worth O
considering. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
there O
is O
anything O
further O
we O
can O
do O
to O
improve O
his O
distal O
blood O
flow. O
Further O
imaging O
will O
also O
be O
very O
difficult O
in O
view O
of O
the O
possible O
problems O
with O
gadolinium O
as O
well O
as O
his O
creatinine, O
which O
limit O
contrast O
administration. O
His O
noninvasive O
studies O
suggest O
that O
his O
problems O
are O
all O
diabetic O
small O
vessel O
disease O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
we O
could O
be O
of O

with O
this. O
I O
will O

Her O

showed O
mild O

The O
last O
p-CABG O
ETT O
was O
done O
in O
September, O
2074, O
and O
did O
not O
included O
nuclear O

The O
electrocardiographic O
portion O
of O
both O
tests O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
uninterpretable O
because O
of O
inadequate O
elevation O
of O
the O
heart O

Dr. O

asked O
her O
to O
double O

Since O

Dr. O

He O

She O

She O

who O
has O

surgery O
since O
a O

did O
not O

Brings O
no O

No O
severe O

Retinopathy: O
Saw O
Dr. O
Aragon O
yesterday. O
Stable. O
Last O
laser O

Nephropathy: O

She O
does O
not O
recall O
when O
her O

checked O
but O
says O
that O
it O
was O
prior O

January O
and O
that O
results O
were O
sent O
to O
Dr. O
Hayes. O
Neuropathy: O
Not O
much O
troubled O
by O

She O
still O

showed O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
Reglan O
would O
help, O
but O
have O
reluctance O
to O
try O
it O
in O
any O
case O
because O
of O
her O
long O
history O
of O
depression. O
Cardiac: O
She O
thinks O
that O
she O
may O
be O
having O
dyspnea O
on O

that O
is O
easier O
to O
precipitate O
than O
it O
had O
been. O
She O
has O
had O
some O
sternal O
discomfort O
at O
rest O
on O
two O
occasions O
while O
sitting O
at O

- O
felt O

She O
says O
that O
she O
has O

trying O
to O
ignore O
the O
possible O
increase O
in O
dyspnea O

disease I-CAD
and O
his O
left O
wrist. O
His O
right O
hip O
continues O
to O
be O
painful O
at O
times. O
A O
radiogram O
in O
December O
showed O
that O
he O
has O
osteoarthritis O
in O
that O
hip. O
He O
has O
been O
taking O
Motrin O
twice O
a O
day O
and O
finds O
that O
he O
does O
get O
some O
relief O
with O
that. O
His O
left O
shoulder O
has O
been O
bothering O
him O
for O
awhile O
but O
it O
is O
actually O
is O
somewhat O
better O
than O
it O
has O
been. O
It O
hurts O
to O
abduct O
him O
more O
than O
90 O
degrees O
or O
to O
reach O
behind O
his O
back. O
His O
left O
wrist O
is O
bothering O
him O
some O
now. O
It O
is O
sore O
with O
most O
types O
of O
motion. O
Regarding O
his O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
his O
blood O
sugar O
today O
was O
190 O
early O
this O
morning. O
Regarding O
his O
coronary B-CAD
disease, I-CAD
he O
has O
been O
walking O
every O
morning. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
chest O
pain O
pressure O
or O
discomfort. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
Blood O
pressure O
is O
110/70, O
weight O
is O
192 O
pounds, O

a O
little O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Right O
hip: O
I O
think O
he O
has O
degenerative O
joint O
disease O

I O
want O
him O
to O
continue O
on O
the O
Motrin O
as O
needed. O
2. O
Left O
shoulder: O
I O
may O
well O
have O
bursitis O
here. O
He O
feels O
this O
has O
improved O
a O
lot O
and O
he O
would O
just O
as O
soon O
not O
do O
anything O
different O
for O
now O
but O
will O
let O
me O
know O
if O
it O
causes O
more O
problems. O

Interval O
History: O
Ms. O
Kong O
presents O
to O
follow-up O
her O
recent O
hospitalizations. O
Briefly, O
she O
was O
admitted O
in O
early O
April O
with O
Group O
B O
strep O
bacteremia O
and O
AoV O
endocarditis O
with O
mod O
to O
severe O
AI. O
The O
source O
of O
GBS O
bacteremia O
remains O
unclear O
although O
she O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
shingles O
a O
few O
weeks O
prior O
and O
may O
have O
caused O
a O
cutaneous O
innoculation. O
Pre-op O
angiogram O
showed O
no O
significant O
CAD. O
On O
4/5/89 O
she O
underwent O
composite O
aortic O
root O
replacement O
with O
a O
20mm O
life O
net O
aortic O
homograft O
by O
Dr. O
Jerome. O
Due O
to O
heavily O
calcified O
RCA O
ostium, O
a O
button O
for O
re-implantation O
couldn't O
be O
created O
so O
she O
recieved O
a O
single O
vessel O
SVG O
to O
prox O
RCA. O
Post O
op O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
afib O
with O
high O
grade O
AV O
block O
for O
which O
she O
recieved O
a O
dual O
chamber O
PPM. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
rehab O
with O
a O
PICC O
to O
complete O
a O
course O
of O
IV O
PCN. O
However, O
she O
was O
re-admitted O
in O
early O
May O
while O
still O
at O
rehab O
with O
an O
episode O
of O
chest O
pain O
at O
rest. O
ECG O
was O
paced O
but O
biomarkers O
were O
mildly O
positive O
(troponin O
~0.5). O
TTE O
showed O
the O
valve O
was O
well O
seated O
without O
suggestion O
of O
recurrent O
endocarditis. O
There O
was O
a O
new O
apical O
WMA. O
She O
underwent O
cath O
which O
showed O
patent O
BPG O
and O
no O
significant O
CAD. O
The O
episode O
was O
attributed O
to O
embolic O
phenomenon O
(? O
from O
afib, O
INR O
1.5 O
on O
admission). O
She O
was O
discharged O
back O
to O
rehab O
and O
has O
done O
well O
since. O
She O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
ID O
clinic O
and O
the O
PICC O
line O
was O
pulled. O
She's O
back O
home O
from O
rehab O
now O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
fairly O
well. O
She O
gets O
fatigued O
easily O
and O
has O
to O
rest O
after O
walking O
about O
a O
100 O
yards. O
However, O
she O
denies O
CP, O
SOB, O
palpitations, O
presyncope O
or O
focal O
neurologic O
deficits. O
No O
F/C O
or O
weight O
loss. O
She O
has O
a O
long O
history O
of O
bilateral O
calf O
caludication O
but O
she O
isn't O
exerting O
herself O
enough O
to O
elicit O
symptoms. O
While O
at O
rehab, O
she O
was O
sleeping O
on O
4 O
pillows O
and O
would O
develop O
orthopnea O
if O
sleeping O
flat. O
Now O
she's O
sleeping O
on O
2 O
pillows O
for O
comfort O
and O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
have O
anymore O
orthopnea. O
However, O
she O
does O
experience O
what O
sounds O
like O
PND O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
per O
week. O
She O
denies O
LE O
edema. O
She's O
tolerating O
all O
medications O
well. O

To O
that O
end, O
I've O
referred O
her O
to O
the O
cardiac O
rehab O
program O
at O
Glenbeigh O
Hospital O
(closer O
to O
home). O
She O
has O
occasional O
episodes O
of O
possible O
PND O
but O
no O
other O
evidence O
of O
volume O
overload O
on O
exam. O
If O
her O
symptoms O
persist, O
I've O
asked O
her O
to O
notify O
me O
and O
we'll O
try O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
lasix. O
In O
terms O
of O
rhythm O
issues, O
she O
is O
now O
completely O
paced. O
She O
probably O
doesn't O
need O
amio O
anymore O
so O
we'll O
stop O
it O
today. O
In O
terms O
of O
coumadin, O
it's O
probably O
reasonable O
to O
continue O
for O
3 O
months O
following O
valve O
replacement. O
She's O
due O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Jerome O
next O
month; O
we'll O
defer O
to O
him O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
duration O
of O
post-op O
anti-coagulation O
from O
a O
bioprosthetic O
valve O
perspective. O
With O
regard O
to O
Afib, O
she O
had O
post-op O
Afib O
but O
now O
she's O
atrially O
paced. O
If O
future O
PPM O
interogations O
don't O
reveal O
underlying O
Afib, O
she O
may O
not O
need O
coumadin O
in O
the O
long O
run. O
She'll O
return O
to O
clinic O
in O
6 O
months O
or O
sooner O
prn. O

of O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
non-insulin-dependent B-DIABETES
diabetes, I-DIABETES
and O
2 O
weeks O
of O
intermittent O
chest O
pain O
for O
which O
he O
was O
evaluated O
with O
stress O
test O
a O
week O
prior O
to O
ED O
visit, O
which O
was O
abnormal. O
The O
patient O
had O
a O
plan O
for O
cardiac O
catheterization O
the O
day O
after O
this O
ED O
visit O
but O
presented O
on O
this O
day O
for O
an O
episode O
of O
chest O
discomfort O
which O
occurred O
at O
rest, O
which O
was O
unlike O
his O
previous O
episodes O
of O
chest O
discomfort O
which O
usually O
occurred O
with O
activity. O
He O
took O
nitroglycerin B-MEDICATION
with O
relief O
and O
then O
presented O
for O
further O
evaluation O
and O
treatment. O
MEDICATIONS: O
Metformin, B-MEDICATION
Toprol, B-MEDICATION
Cozaar, B-MEDICATION
nitro, O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
and O
Altace. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
He O
is O
awake O
and O
alert, O
in O
no O
distress, O
chest O
pain O
free. O
Afebrile O
with O
pulse O
72, O
blood O
pressure O
129/69, O
and O
O2 O
saturation O
98% O
on O
room O
air. O
His O
lungs O
are O

Abdomen O
is O
soft O
and O
nontender. O
Extremities O
are O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused. O
No O

EMERGENCY O
DEPARTMENT O
COURSE: O
An O
EKG O
was O
done O
revealing O
right O
bundle-branch O
block, O
but O
sinus O
rhythm O
at O
67 O
with O
no O
ischemic O
changes. O
IV O
access O
was O
established. O
Labs O
were O
sent O
revealing O
essentially O
normal O
CBC O
and O
electrolytes. O
Initial O
troponin O
was O
less O
than O
assay O
with O
an O
INR O
of O
1.1 O
and O
chest O
x-ray, O
which O
was O
normal. O
The O
patient O
has O
been O
taking O
aspirin O
prior O
to O
arrival. O
Heart O
rate O
was O
in O
the O
60s O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
and O
no O
additional O
beta-blockade O
was O
given O
to O
the O
patient. O
However, O
based O
on O
his O
story, O
which O
was O
suggestive O
for O
unstable O
angina, O
he O
was O
given O
Lovenox O
in O
the O
emergency O
room. O
I O
spoke O
to O
the O
Cardiology O
B O

agreed O
to O
take O
the O
patient O
on O
to O
his O
service O
for O
probable O
cardiac O
catheterization O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
With O
this O
plan, O
he O
was O
admitted O
in O
stable O
condition O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
unstable O
angina. O

with O
progressive B-CAD
angina I-CAD
and O
a O

His O
cardiac B-CAD
troponin I-CAD
rose I-CAD
to I-CAD
0.13. I-CAD
There O
were O
no O
demonstrable O
ECG O
changes, O
though O
we O
queried O
the O

event. O
He O
had O
been O
previously O
scheduled O
for O
semi-urgent O

on O
07/26/2060. O
His O
condition O
stabilized O
with O

therapy. O
He O
was O
taken O
to O
the O

laboratory O
by O
Dr. O
Otero O
on O
07/26/2060. O
Angiography B-CAD
demonstrated I-CAD
a I-CAD
high-grade I-CAD
lesion I-CAD
in I-CAD
the I-CAD
proximal I-CAD
portion I-CAD
of I-CAD
a I-CAD
large I-CAD
first I-CAD
diagonal I-CAD

well I-CAD
as I-CAD
a I-CAD
significant I-CAD
stenosis I-CAD
in I-CAD
the I-CAD

branch. I-CAD
The O
diagonal O
lesion O
was O
managed O
with O
angioplasty B-CAD
and I-CAD
deployment I-CAD
of I-CAD
a I-CAD
drug-eluting I-CAD

stent I-CAD
could I-CAD
not I-CAD
be I-CAD
delivered I-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
obtuse I-CAD
marginal I-CAD
lesion; I-CAD
a I-CAD

He O
did O
have O
smoldering O
chest O
discomfort O
of O
an O

nature O
following O
the O
procedure. O
The O
cardiac O
troponin O
elevated O
further O
to O
a O

value O
of O
0.86 O
as O
of O
07/27/2060 O
(08:54). O
He O
also O
had O
a O
mild, O
vagal O
reaction O
characterized O
by O

and O
transient O
bradycardia. O
He O
felt O
much O

the O
following O
day. O
A O

troponin O
returned O
at O
a O
lower O
level O
of O

Dear O
Dr. O
Peralta: O
I O
saw O
your O
patient, O
Dr. O
Gipson, O
in O
the O
Cardiology O
Office O
today O
on O
a O
somewhat O
urgent O
basis. O
He O
was O
recently O
in O
Italy O
last O
week O
with O
very O
difficult O
events O
concerning O
his O
father's O
ill O
health. O
His O
father O
ultimately O
died O
and O
was O
a O
very O
traumatic O
series O
of O
days O
for O
Dr. O
Gipson O
and O
his O
family. O
He O
developed O
left O
chest O
discomfort, O
which O
persisted O
for O
a O
number O
of O
days. O
He O
was O
afraid O
to O
take O
nitroglycerin O
despite O
knowing O
that O
he O
should, O
and O
therefore O
remained O
with O
chest O
discomfort O
for O
about O
six O
days. O
He O
was O
able O
to O
be O
reasonably O
active O
and O
had O
no O
exacerbation O
of O
his O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
had O
no O
nausea, O
vomiting, O
diaphoresis, O
or O
palpitations. O
He O
then O
returned O
to O
the O
United O
States O
and O
his O
symptoms O
have O
resolved. O
Because O
of O
these O
discomforts, O
he O
wanted O
to O
undergo O
an O
additional O
evaluation. O
We O
performed O
an O
exercise O
treadmill O
test O
with O
perfusion O
imaging O
two O
days O
ago O
for O
better O
understanding O
of O
his O
symptoms. O
He O
exercised O
for O
7 O
minutes O
and O
30 O
seconds O
on O
the O
standard O
Bruce O
protocol O
to O
a O
peak O
heart O
rate O
of O
122 O
beats O
per O
minute O
(84% O
of O
maximum O
predicted O
for O
age) O
and O
peak O
blood O
pressure O
of O
162/80. O
He O
stopped O
because O
of O
dyspnea O
and O
had O
some O
discomfort. O
The O
discomfort O
resolved O
into O
recovery. O
He O
had O
no O
ST O
segment O
changes. O
His O
perfusion O
scan O
demonstrated O
normal O
LV O
size O
and O
normal O
tracer O
uptake O
in O
the O
lungs. O
There O
was O
normal O
RV O
size O
as O

There O
was O
a O
small-to-medium O
medium-sized O
defect O
of O
moderate O

in O
the O

the O

study O
he O
had O
in O

As O
you O
may O
remember, O
in O
January O
2061, O
he O
underwent O
cardiac O
catheterization O
that O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
non-major O
flow-limiting O
obstructions O
and O
so O
no O
intervention O
was O
performed. O
His O
current O

On O
exam O
today, O
he O
is O
comfortable O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
135/75, O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
60 O
and O
regular, O
and O
weight O
of O
189 O
pounds. O
Head O
and O
neck O
are O
unremarkable. O
Chest O
is O
clear. O
Cardiac O
exam O
shows O
no O
jugular O
venous O
distention O
at O
30 O
degrees. O
PMI O
is O
normal. O
S1 O
and O
S2 O
are O
normal O
with O
a O
physiologic O
split. O
There O
is O
an O
S4 O
and O
1/6 O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
at O
the O
left O
sternal O
border. O
Abdominal O
exam O
is O
unremarkable O
without O
organomegaly. O
Bowel O
sounds O
are O
normal. O
The O
extremities O
show O
no O
edema O
or O
cyanosis. O
Carotid O
upstrokes O
are O
normal O
in O
contour O
and O
volume O
without O
bruit. O
Distal O
pulses O
are O
normal. O
His O
resting O
12-lead O
electrocardiogram O
demonstrates O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
and O
normal O
morphology. O
I O
think O
Dr. O
Gipson O
is O
basically O
doing O
very O
well. O
I O
think O
his O
chest O
discomforts O
for O
six O
days O
while O
in O
Italy O
may O
be O
related O
to O
anxiety O
and O
perhaps O
the O
known O
gastroesophageal O
reflux O
disease O
that O
he O
has. O
I O
think O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
discomfort O
was O
cardiac O
in O
origin. O
His O
exercise O
capacity O
is O
quite O
good O
and O
his O
perfusion O
is O
actually O
somewhat O
even O
improved O
from O
his O
prior O
evaluation O
two O
years O
ago. O
I O
think O
we O
can O
maintain O
our O
current O
approach. O
I O
suggest O
that O
I O
see O
him O
in O
a O
number O
of O
months O
for O
future O
evaluation. O
If O
any O
problems O
develop O
in O
the O
interim, O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
help O
with O
his O
care. O
Kindest O
regards. O
Sincerely O
yours, O

Hendrickson, O
Ora O
MRN: O
7194334 O
This O
patient O
is O
here O
for O
a O
follow-up. O
She O
was O
seen O
with O
a O
very O
complete O
evaluation O
by O
Ida O
Oquinn O
for O
her O
recurrent O
urinary O
tract O
infections. O
She O
submitted O
a O
urine O
sample O
initially O
that O
appeared O
fairly O
clean O
but O
then O
after O
straight O
cathing O
her O
urine O
Ida O
was O
able O
to O
obtain O
cloudy O
foul O
smelling O
urine. O
A O
fair O
amount O
retained O
as O
postvoid O
residual. O
Ms. O
Hendrickson O
completed O
her O
14 O
days O
of O
Levaquin O
with O
resolution O
of O
her O
symptoms O
but O
now O
over O
the O
past O
few O
days O
she O
has O
noticed O
an O
odor O
and O
cloudiness O
to O
her O
urine O
again O
without O
fevers O
of O
dysuria O
or O
urinary O
urgency. O
She O
has O
anxiety O
associated O
with O
the O
possible O
reasons O
why O
she O
should O
have O
recurrent O
infections. O
She O
is O
most O
concerned O
about O
having O
cancer. O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Quezada O
March O
24th. O
The O
patient O
reports O
increased O
anxiety O
of O
late O
as O
there O
have O
been O
issues O
going O
around O
the O
housing O
projects. O
A O
14-year-old O
girl O
was O
raped O
and O
one O
week O
later O
an O
individual O
was O
climbing O
a O
tree O
to O
try O
to O
get O
into O
her O
apartment. O
She O
ended O
up O
combating O
him O
with O
a O
broom O
and O
he O
ran O
away. O
She O
did O
not O
file O
a O
police O
report. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
she O
has O
had O
more O
problems O
with O
her O
anxiety. O
She O
reports O
compliance O
with O
all O
her O
medications O
except O
that O
she O
ran O
out O
of O
her O
Lasix O
approximately O
one O
week O
ago. O
She O
had O
been O
taking O
20 O
mg O
one-half O
to O
one O
tablet O
sporadically O
but O
not O
on O
a O
regular O
basis. O
She O
denies O
any O
chest O
pressure O
or O
palpitations. O
She O
denies O
any O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
She O
denies O
any O
problems O
with O
pain O
in O
her O
right O
foot O
or O
increased O
swelling O
of O
her O
left O
ankle. O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
(1) O
Hypertension. B-HYPERTENSION
Blood O
pressure O
has O
been O
high O
over O
the O
past O
two O
visits. O
This O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
has O
not O
been O
taking O
her O
Lasix. O
I O
have O
restarted O
her O
on O
the O
Lasix O
20 O
mg O
to O
take O
one-half O
tablet O
q.d. O
on O
a O

I O
will O
write O
a O

(3) O
Recurrent O
urinary O

She O
had O
a O

today. O
She O
was O
given O
another O

PO O
q.d. O
She O
will O
stay O
on O
this O
until O
her O
appointment O
with O
Dr. O
Quezada. O
I O
attempted O
to O
reassure O
her O
that O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
cancer O
is O
the O
cause O
for O
her O
current O
recurrent O
infections. O
It O
is O
more O
likely O
due O
to O
her O
cystocele. O
(4) O

This O
appears O

She O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
This O
is O
a O
65-year-old O
female O
who O
presents O
for O
evaluation O
of O
chest O
pain. O
The O
patient O
had O
no O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
until O
the O
last O
week. O
She O
was O
apparently O
in O
Pennsylvania O
where O
she O
had O
been O
for O
the O
last O
week. O
She O
had O
been O
having O
5 O
days O
of O
epigastric O
and O
substernal O
discomfort. O
She O
considered O
it O
to O
be O
indigestion O
and O
have O
been O
taking O
Tums. O
After O
approximately O
5 O
days O
while O
in O
Pennsylvania, O
she O
felt O
that O
the O
discomfort O
was O
not O
improving. O
She O
did O
feel O
like O
that O
she O
had O
less O
energy O
for O
her O
usual O
activity. O
She O
went O
to O
a O
hospital O
there O
in O
her O
land O
of O
Pennsylvania O
where O
she O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
a O
positive O
troponin. O
She O
underwent O
a O
diagnostic B-CAD
catheterization I-CAD
that I-CAD
did I-CAD
show I-CAD
multivessel I-CAD
disease I-CAD
with I-CAD
an I-CAD
occluded I-CAD
LAD. I-CAD
She O
subsequently O
underwent O
a O
therapeutic O
PCI O
with O
stenting B-CAD
of I-CAD
her I-CAD
LAD. I-CAD
She O
did O
have O
recurrent O
chest O
pain O
today O
after O
catheterization, O
which O
was O
much O
more O
severe, O
sharper O
in O
nature O
per O
her O
description. O
She O
was O
told O
in O
the O
hospital O
in O
Pennsylvania O
that O
this O
was O
due O
to O
reperfusion. O
She O
returned O
home O
today, O
called O
her O
primary O
care O
physician O
and O
was O
advised O
to O
come O
to O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
for O
evaluation. O
She O
does O
state O
that O
since O
discharge O
from O
the O
hospital O
in O
Pennsylvania O
earlier O
this O
week, O
she O
has O
had O
intermittent O
episodes O
of O
more O
severe O
left O
anterior O
chest O
pain, O
which O
she O
describes O
as O
somewhat O
more O
sharp O
than O
the O
indigestion O
feeling O
she O
was O
experiencing O
before. O
It O
is O
not O
always O
associated O
with O
exertion. O
It O
sometimes O
radiates O
to O
her O
left O
shoulder. O
It O
is O
not O
pleuritic O
in O
nature. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
intermittent, O
although O
she O
does O
have O
a O
low O
level O
of O
dull O
aching O
pain, O
which O
has O
been O
fairly O
constant O
since O
her O
discharge O
from O
Pennsylvania. O
She O
denies O
any O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
She O
is O

to O
lie O
flat. O
Denies O
any O
lower O
extremity O

I O

woman O
with O
type B-DIABETES
I I-DIABETES
diabetes I-DIABETES
who O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
followup. O
We O
have O
had O
heron O
the O
insulin B-MEDICATION
pump I-MEDICATION
now O
for O
close O
to O
six O
months O
and O
recently O
she O
had O
had O
continuous O
blood O
glucose O
monitoring. O
We O
had O
gone O
over O
these O
results O
over O
the O
phone O
and O
I O
had O
made O
some O
adjustments. O
Particularly O
she O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
late O
morning O
hyperglycemia O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
change O
her O
carbohydrate O
to O
bolus O
ratio O
during O
the O
morning O
hours O
and O
this O
has O
resulted O
in O
tremendous O
improvement O
in O
her O
blood O
sugars. O
She O
brings O
them O
in O
today O
and O
the O
results O
look O
excellent. O
She O
has O
had O
no O
other O
concerns O
of O
late. O
We O
have O
not O
tested O
her O
hemoglobin O
A1c O
in O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time, O
so O
she O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
further O
evaluation. O

woman O
who O
comes O
in O
today O
with O
review O
of O
her O
type B-DIABETES
1 I-DIABETES
diabetes. I-DIABETES
She O
is O
doing O
much O
better O
on O
the O
pump O
than O
she O
was O
before O
especially O
with O
the O
recent O
adjustments O
we O
made. O
We O
will O
continue O
with O
the O
pump O
and O
she O
will O
continue O
to O
send O
me O
her O
blood O
sugars O
every O
two O
weeks O
until O
we O
get O
this O
under O
control. O
We O
will O
check O
a O
hemoglobin O

today. O
She O
is O
up-to-date O
with O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
health O
maintenance O
including O
seeing O
a O

with O
this. O
3. O
Neck O
pain. O
Intermittent O
neck O
pain O
is O
most O
likely O
from O
degenerative O
disease. O
I O
did O
not O
find O
anything O
on O
neurological O
exam O
that O
was O
concerning. O
I O
did O
encourage O
her O
to O
actually O
take O
some O
Naprosyn O
as O
needed O
for O
this O
pain, O
but O
not O
to O
take O
it O
on O
a O
continuous O
basis O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time. O
She O
has O
had O
some O
problems O
with O
some O
blood O
in O
the O
stool O
and O
I O
feel O
that O
she O
is O
due O
for O
colonoscopy. O
I O
did O
recommend O
that O
she O
get O
one O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
ADDENDUM: O

Dear O
Fitzgerald: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient, O
Haden O
Doty, O
in O
consultation O
today O
regarding O
his O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
and O
generalized O
vascular O
disease. O
As O
you O
know, O
he O
is O
a O
patient O
that O
has O
known O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
for O
which O
I O
ended O
up O
doing O
a O
catheterization O
on O
08/27/2157, O
and O
that O
was O
done O
because O
of O
an O
abnormal O
stress O
test O
and O
chest O
pain. O
At O
that O
time, O
he O
had O
been O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Morgan O
Thayer, O
who O
performed O
a O
stress B-CAD
MIBI I-CAD
and I-CAD
demonstrated I-CAD
an I-CAD
inferoposterior I-CAD
ischemia, I-CAD
a O
low O
workload O
of O
3 O
minutes O
and O
18 O
seconds, O
and O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
only O
72% O
of O
predicted. O
The O
LV O
chamber O
was O
dilated, O
and O
the O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
estimated O
at O
48%, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
suggestion O
of O
global O
ischemia. O
The O
catheterization O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
moderate B-CAD
diffuse I-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
plaque O
distributed O
throughout O
much O
of O
the O
coronary O
tree, O
some O
calcification, O
and O
narrow O
caliber O
vessels O
overall, O
but O
no O
focal O
high-grade O
stenoses. O
There O
was O
some O
disease O
in O
the O
distal O
left O
main O
coronary O
artery, O
but O
his O
angina O
or O
ischemia O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
excess O
demand O
in O
the O
phase O
of O
globally O
diminished O
supply. O
He O
was O
treated O
medically O
for O
the O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
his O
cath, O
he O
also O
underwent O
an O
angiography O
of O
his O
abdominal O
aorta O
and O
selective O
angiogram O
of O
his O
left O
leg, O
because O
he O
was O
complaining O
of O
claudication O
predominantly O
on O
the O
left O
calf O
at O
that O
time. O
That O
study O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
two O
renal O
arteries O
of O
the O
left O
side, O
a O
small O
superior O
one O
that O
was O
narrowed O
by O
about O
50%, O
and O
a O
larger O
inferior O
left O
renal O
artery O
that O
was O
narrowed O
by O
about O
60%. O
The O
right O
side O
was O
patent. O
With O
respect O
to O
the O
abdominal O
aorta, O
there O
was O
an O
ulcerated O
plaque O
just O
below O
the O
superior O
renal O
artery, O
narrowing O
the O
channel O
in O
the O
aorta O
by O
about O
30% O
or O
40%. O
The O
iliac O
vessels O
were O
patent, O
and O
the O
left O
common O
femoral O
artery O
had O
some O
irregularity O
that O
was O
patent. O
The O
left O
SFA, O
a O
diffusely O
diseased O
vessel, O
had O
a O
high-grade O
stenosis O
of O
about O
80% O
in O
the O
adductor O
canal. O
Then, O
at O
the O
trifurcation, O
there O
was O
occlusion O
or O
high-grade O
stenosis O
of O
all O
three O
trifurcation O
vessels O
on O
the O
left O
side. O
There O
was O
reconstitution O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
ankle. O
The O
decision O
at O
that O
time O
was O
made O
to O
treat O
him O
conservatively, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
present, O
since O
he O
was O
still O
playing O
golf O
three O
to O
four O
times O
a O
week. O
He O
also O
apparently O
had O
some O
other O
issues, O
so O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
again O
in O
followup. O
The O
original O
plan O
had O
been O
to O
bring O
him O
back O
for O
revascularization O
of O
his O
left O
renal O
artery O
and O
the O
left O
SFA. O
He O
did O
have O
back O
surgery O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
when O
he O
became O
significantly O
crippled O
by O
his O
lumbar O
spinal O
stenosis. O
Dr. O
Anders O
Sykes O
performed O
an O
L3-L4, O
L4-L5 O
decompressive O
laminectomy. O
This O
had O
a O
dramatically O
positive O
effect O
on O
his O
back O
pain. O
The O
biggest O
problem O
now O
is O
that O
he O
feels O
that O
he O
cannot O
walk O
as O
far O
and O
his O
exercise O
tolerance O
has O
decreased. O
He O
has O
been O
an O
avid O
golfer O
in O
the O
past, O
but O
is O
now O
having O
some O
more O
difficulty O
with O
that. O
Even O
when O
I O
saw O
him O
two O
years O
ago, O
he O
was O
using O
a O
cart O
to O
play O
three O
or O
four O
times O
a O
week. O
He O
still O
is O
able O
to O
play O
golf, O
but O
if O
he O
walks O
about O
100 O
yards, O
he O
starts O
feeling O
his O
calves, O
and O
now O
the O
symptoms O
are O
bilateral O
and O
equal. O
He O
also O
has O
some O
numbness O
in O
his O
toes, O
which O
is O
constant, O
and O
his O
feet O
feel O
cold O
much O
of O
the O
time. O
The O
symptoms O
of O
claudication O
have O
increased O
over O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
years. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
has O
been O
reasonably O
stable. O
He O
tells O
me O
that O
you O
get O
pressures O
of O
120-130. O
He O
has O
not O
been O
taking O
his O
blood O
pressure O
at O
home, O
but O
he O
does O
take O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
medication, O
see O
below. O
Of O
note, O
his O
son O
says O
that O
when O
he O
was O
in O
Michigan, O
he O
was O
playing O
18 O
holes O
of O
golf O
regularly, O
sometimes O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
per O
day, O
but O
Haas O
notes O
that O
he O
was O
indeed O
limited O
by O
claudication O
even O
though O
he O
was O
able O
to O
play O
the O
golf O
down O
in O
Michigan. O
He O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
limited O
up O
here O
since O
returning O
just O
a O
short O
time O
ago. O
He O
also O
says O
that O
he O
feels O
like O
he O
has O
got O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
move, O
and O
if O
he O
does O
not O
play O
any O
golf O
at O
all, O
he O
will O
really O
deteriorate. O
Of O
note, O
the O
discomfort O
is O
not O
only O
limited O
to O
the O
calves, O
but O
also O
there O
is O
some O
discomfort O
in O
the O
hips, O
though O
not O
nearly O
as O
bad O
and O
not O
as O
limiting. O
Of O
note, O
he O
has O
been O
seeing O
Dr. O
Youngman O
for O
his O
legs O
and O
has O
been O
told O
to O
'walk O
walk O
walk.' O
At O
this O
point, O
he O
feels O
that O
he O
cannot O
walk O
as O
well O
or O
enough O
to O
follow O
through O
on O
his O
instructions. O

to O
the O

This O
will O
help O
give O
us O
a O
road O
map O
as O
to O
how O
we O
can O
approach O
revascularization O
of O
his O
legs O
to O
make O
him O
feel O
better. O
I O
already O
know O
that O
I O
can O
open O
up O
his O
left O
SFA O
and O
probably O
his O
left O
trifurcation O
vessels O
below O
the O

but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
the O
right O
side O
and O
also O
get O
another O
look O
at O
the O
aortoiliac O
vessels, O
since O
it O
has O
been O
a O
full O
two O
years. O
2. O
Continue O
appropriate O

as O
you O
are O
doing. O
3. O
We O
will O
obtain O
blood O
work O
today O
in O
preparation O
for O
revascularization. O
4. O
I O
need O
to O
get O
carotid O
noninvasive O
studies, O
since O
it O
has O
been O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
anyway. O
Impression: O
1. O
Peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
- O
progressive O
claudication, O
now O
involving O
both O
legs O
at O
an O
equal O
amount O
and O
limiting O
him O
in O
terms O
of O
daily O
activities. O
We O
know O
that O
he O
has O
high-grade O
disease O
in O
the O
left O
leg, O
below O
the O
groin, O
which O
can O
be O
treated. O
Right O
leg O
has O
not O
been O
examined O
in O
the O
past. O
Also O
has O
an O
ulcerative O
plaque O
in O
the O
aorta, O
which O
might O
be O
best O
left O
alone. O
2. O
Renal O
vascular O
disease O
- O
known O
moderately O
severe O
stenosis O
left O
main O
and O
accessory O
renal O
arteries. O
Blood O
pressure O
is O
under O
reasonable O
control. O
Need O
to O
check O
his O
creatinine O
and O
BUN. O
If O
they O
are O
okay, O
then O
we O
would O
leave O
him O
alone. O
He O
is O
however O
on O
a O
total O
of O
six O
antihypertensive O
medications, O
so O
consideration O
of O
renal O
artery O
revascularization O
is O
certainly O
something O
to O
entertain. O

RE: O
Peter O

MR O
#453-39-84-4 O
Dear O
Dr. O
Craft: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
meeting O
Peter O
Joshi O
in O
the O
Cardiology O
Clinic O
on O
February O
24th. O
Mr. O
Joshi O
presents O
with O
a O
complaint O
of O
dyspnea O
and O
oxygen O
requirement. O
The O
patient O
does O
relate O
that O
he O
has O
had O
breathing O
problems O
in O
the O
past O
and O
in O
fact, O
markedly O
worse O
several O
years O
ago. O
However, O
with O
the O
treatment O
of O
his O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
he O
had O
been O
doing O
somewhat O
better O
until O
he O
underwent O
surgery O
for O
a O
carotid O
artery O
stenosis. O
Since O
that O
surgery O
several O
months O
ago, O
he O
has O
had O
a O
prolonged O
period O
of O
time O
during O
which O
he O
has O
required O
supplemental O
oxygen. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
patient O
is O
being O
treated O
for O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
in O
fact, O
has O
had O
a O
recent O
increase O
in O
his O
dose O
of O
standing O
Lasix. O
The O
patient O
relates O
that O
during O
his O
hospitalization, O
he O
did O
have O
what O
sounds O
like O
a O
pleural O
effusion, O
which O
a O
physician O
did O
try O
to O
drain, O
however, O
unsuccessfully. O
At O
the O
current O
time, O
Mr. O
Joshi O
is O
feeling O
slowly O
better O
and O
feels O
as O
though O
he O
is O
able O
to O
take O
a O
deep O
breath, O
which O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
do O
several O
months O
ago. O
In O
fact, O
he O
was O
told O
recently O
that O
he O
does O
not O
need O
supplemental O
oxygen. O
He O
denies O
a O
chronic O
cough, O
although O
he O
does O
occasionally O
have O
some O
difficulty O
swallowing O
which O
leads O
to O
coughing. O
His O
past O
medical O
history O
includes O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
carotid O
artery O
stenosis, O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
with O
both O
angioplasty O
and O
stent O
placement, O
congestive O
heart O
failure, O
bladder O
cancer, O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
hypercholesterolemia, B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
gastroesophageal O
reflux, O
and O
upper O
GI O
bleed. O

He B-SMOKER
discontinued I-SMOKER

smoking I-SMOKER
years I-SMOKER
ago. I-SMOKER
On O
exam O
today, O
he O
had O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
122/60. O
His O
pulse O
was O
56, O
afebrile. O
O2 O
sat O
on O
room O
air O
initially O
was O
at O
90%, O
but O
when O
I O
rechecked O
it, O
it O
was O
95%. O
His O
weight O
was O
221 O
lbs. O
He O
is O
in O
no O
respiratory O
distress O
at O
rest. O
His O
oropharynx O
had O
dry O
mucosa O
and O
a O
somewhat O
small O
posterior O
pharyngeal O
air O
space. O
His O
neck O
had O
no O
enlarged O
lymph O
nodes. O
Chest O
had O
diminished O
breath O
sounds O
in O
the O
left O
base O
with O
crackles. O
His O
right O
lung O
was O
clear. O
His O
heart O
was O
in O
a O
regular O
bradycardic O
rhythm O
with O
a O
II/III O
systolic O
murmur. O
His O
abdomen O
was O
protuberant, O
but O
benign. O
His O
extremities O
are O
with O
1+ O
pitting O
edema O
and O
no O
clubbing. O
Pulmonary O
function O
testing O
had O
been O
performed O
in O
December O
and O
was O
repeated O
again O
today, O
which O
demonstrates O
that O
he O
has O
a O
combined O
restrictive O
and O
obstructive O
ventilatory O
defect. O
His O
current O
vital O
capacity O
was O
improved O
approximately O
10% O
from O
that O
of O
December. O
He O
has O
no O
bronchodilator O
response. O
I O
took O
Mr. O
Joshi O
for O
a O
short O
walk O
and O
he O
never O
desaturated O
below O
92% O
and O
that O
includes O
after O
walking O
up O
one O
flight O
of O
stairs. O
In O
summary, O
I O
believe O
that O
Mr. O
Joshi O
has O
dyspnea O
which O
is O
likely O
mostly O
related O
to O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
deconditioning. O
However, O
I O
do O
believe O
he O
might O
have O
a O
pleural O
effusion O
based O
on O
my O
exam O
and O
based O
on O
his O
history O
and O
therefore, O
I O
have O
referred O
him O
to O
have O
a O
decubitus O
chest O
film O
taken. O
Mr. O
Joshi O
had O
several O
questions O
related O
to O
his O
metered O
dose O
inhaler O
use O
and O
I O
have O
recommended O
that O
he O
use O
only O
Combivent O
4x O
a O
day O
regularly. O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
there O
is O
any O
benefit O
to O
be O
gained O
from O
an O
inhaled O
corticosteroid O
for O
this O
gentleman. O
I O
do O
recommend O
that O
he O
get O
daily O
exercise. O
He O
certainly O
needs O
to O
continue O
his O
diuresis O
and O
I O
will O
certainly O
check O
his O
chest O
x-ray O
on O
the O
outside O
chance O
that O
he O
may O
benefit O
from O
a O
pleural O
effusion. O
I O
have O
also O
confirmed O
to O
him O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
requires O
supplemental O
oxygen. O
His O
pulmonary O
function O
testing O
also O
had O
demonstrated O
a O
reduced O
defusion O
capacity, O
however, O
it O
does O
correct O
when O
accounting O
for O
albuterol O
volume O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
either O
an O
interstitial O
lung O
disease O
or O
pulmonary O

Dear O

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Peter O
Joshi O
in O
the O
Cardiovascular O
Clinic O
at O
the O

Regional O
Universitario. O
This O
lovely O
gentleman O
with O
ischemic O
heart O
disease O

congestive O
heart O
failure O
has O
been O
followed O
in O
our O
clinic O
since O
the O
time O
of O
his O
carotid O
endarterectomy O
and O
cardiac O
procedure. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
he O
notes O
that O
he O
has O
been O
very O
minimally O
active O
because O
of O
the O
flooding. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
paroxysms O
of O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
exertional O
neck, O
chest, O

He O
has O
had O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
at O
greater O
than O
4 O
METS O
of O
activity O
and O
he O
does O
have O
mild O
lower O
extremity O
edema. O
His O
medical O

is O
223 O
pounds. O
His O

is O
124/60 O
right O
and O
left O
arm O
seated. O
His O
heart O
rate O
is O
54 O
and O
regular. O
Respiratory O
rate O
is O
10. O
There O
is O
a O
mild O
increase O
in O
jugular O
venous O
pressure. O
Carotids O
are O
without O
bruits. O
Lungs O
are O
actually O
clear O
to O
auscultation O
throughout. O
Cardiovascular O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
but O
no O
gallop O
is O
present. O
His O
abdomen O
is O
soft, O
nontender, O
free O
of O
organomegaly O
and O
bruits. O
Extremities O
are O
notable O
for O
symmetric O

somewhat O
diminished O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
posterior O
tibialis O
and O
mild O
pitting O
edema O
to O

bradycardia O
with O
inverted O

in O
I O
and O
L. O
No O
significant O

Patrick O
Joshi O
looks O
like O

is O
in O
mild O

overload O
at O
the O
present O
time. O
He O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
had O
renal O

Before O
adjusting O

ILLNESS: O
The O
patient O

The O

he O
has O

to O
Tim O
Horton's, O
they O
pretreated O
his O
coffee O
with O
sugar O
as O
a O
role O
and O
he O
thinks O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
diabetic, O
lack O
of O
control O
over O
the O
years. O
He O
has O
been O
eliminating O
concentrated O
sweets O
in O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Annual O
physical, O
preventative O
maintenance. O
The O
patient O
had O
a O
colonoscopy O
in O
2125 O
and O
was O
told O
to O
come O
back O
in O
2130 O
because O
of O
benign O
polyps. O
I O
did O
recommend O
guaiac O
stool O
cards O
today O
for O
home O
testing O
purposes. O
Immunizations O
are O
up-to-date. O
He O
did O
receive O
an O
H1N1 O
and O
a O
seasonal O
flu O
vaccine O
through O
his O
employer O
and O
for O
private O
pharmacies. O
His O
Pneumovax O
is O
due O
to O
be O
a O
booster O
in O
2 O
years' O
time. O
We O
are O
recommending O
a O
PSA O
and O
a O
DRE O
annually O
starting O
today. O
Labs O
were O
also O
drawn O
in O
the O
office O
for O
CBC, O
CMP, O
and O
lipid O
profile. O
The O
patient O
is O
declining O
Zostavax O
at O
this O
time. O
We O
will O
recommend O
a O
followup O
in O
1 O
year O
for O
an O
annual O
physical. O
2. O
Poorly O
controlled O
type O
2 O
diabetes. O
The O
patient O
has O
now O
eliminated O
concentrated O
sweets O
from O
his O
diet, O
although O
I O
do O
suspect O
dietary O
noncompliance O
beyond O
table O
sugar. O
Recommend O
checking O
a O
hemoglobin O
A1c O
today, O
urine O
for O
microalbumin, O
lipid O
panel O
and O
creatinine O
as O
well O
as O
a O
BUN O
and O
a O
GFR. O
I O
would O
recommend O
continuing O
his O
insulin O
NPH O
42 O
units O
daily, O
but O
we O
may O
need O
to O
recommend O
an O
endocrine O
consult O
if O
his O
A1c O
remains O
elevated O
despite O
dietary O
improvement. O
We O
did O
recommend O
aggressive O
weight O
loss O
and O
exercise O
as O
this O
is O
a O
major O
impediment O
to O
his O
glucose O
control. O
I O
would O
recommend O
follow O
up O
in O
3 O
to O
4 O
months. O
3. O
Obesity. B-OBESE
We O
will O
check O
a O
TSH, O
lipid O
panel O
and O
glucose O
to O
ensure O
that O
he O
is O
in O
good O
metabolic O
balance. O
I O
do O
suspect O
continued O
poorly O
controlled O
diabetes O
given O
his O
past O
history. O
4. O
CAD O
with O
history O
of O
DVT. O
He O
has O
had O
an O
ICD O
interrogated O
recently. O
We O
will O
check O
a O
lipid O
panel O
today. O
We O
would O
like O
to O
strive O
for O
an O
LDL O
less O
than O
70 O
given O
his O
high O
risk O
status, O
I O
would O
recommend O
changing O
his O
steroid O
to O
a O
higher O
dose O
if O
required O
at O
that O
point. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Patton: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O
Michael O
Ogrady O
in O
consultation O
for O
his O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
before O
his O
surgery O
for O
esophageal O
cancer. O
As O
you O
know, O
this O
is O
a O
63-year-old O
male O
with O
a O
long O
past O
medical O
history O
which O
includes O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
peripheral O
vascular O
disease, O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
smoking B-SMOKER
history, I-SMOKER
hypercholesterolemia, B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
DVT O
and O
newly O
diagnosed O
esophageal O
carcinoma. O
He O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
his O
cardiologist, O
Yehuda O
Landers, O
for O
the O
last O
nine O
years. O
Essentially O
he O
has O
every O
cardiac O
risk O
factor O
and O
known O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
which O
is O
documented O
on O
cardiac O
catheterization O
performed O
on O
1/20/93. O
The O
catheterization O
demonstrated O
right O
dominant O
system O
with O
100% O
RCA O
lesion, O
a O
complex O
30% O
diagonal O
1 O
lesion O
and O
a O
30% O
marginal O
1 O
lesion. O
There O
was O
collateral O
flow O
noted O
from O
the O
LAD O
to O
the O
right O
PDA O
and O
from O
the O
septal O
2 O
branch O
to O
the O
RCA, O
and O
from O
the O
circumflex O
artery O
to O
the O
RCA. O
The O
procedure O
was O
performed O
through O
the O
right O
radial O
artery O
without O
complications. O
Patient O
also O
has O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
is O
status O
post O
a O
left O
femoral O
posterior O
tibial O
saphenous O
vein O
bypass O
graft O
in O
2088. O
He O
is O
also O
status O
post O
atherectomy O
and O
dilatation O
of O
stenosis O
in O
the O
femoral O
to O
posterior O
tibial O
graft. O
He O
also O
had O
a O
left O
leg O
DVT O
in O
2090. O
His O
activity O
level O
is O
limited O
by O
his O
claudication. O
He O
has O
a O
history O
of O
hypertension O
and O
hypercholesterolemia O
and O
diabetes O
on O
treatment. O
At O
baseline O
he O
has O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
after O
walking O
half O
a O
mile. O
He O
gets O
chest O
pressure O
one O
to O
two O
times O
a O
month. O
However, O
his O
activity O
is O
extremely O
limited. O
He O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
had O
a O
positive O
stress O
test. O
Further O
information O
is O
not O
available. O
Patient O
understands O
he O
has O
coronary O
disease, O
however O
does O
not O
have O
amenable O
disease O
for O
angioplasty. O
On O
catheterization O
he O
had O
preserved O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
62%. O
He O
is O
to O
undergo O
esophageal O
cancer O
surgery O
in O
the O
next O
one O
to O
two O
months O
after O
receiving O
chemotherapy O
and O
radiation O

preop. O
Patient O
states O
he O

He O
clearly O
has O
ischemia B-CAD
on I-CAD
a I-CAD
positive I-CAD

test. I-CAD
I O
would O
recommend O
dobutamine O

to O
check O
ischemic O
threshold. O
He O
is O
clearly O
at O
intermediate O
risk O
for O
a O
perioperative O
cardiac O
event. O
However, O
given O
his O
life-threatening O
esophageal O
carcinoma, O
patient O
wants O
to O
proceed O
with O
surgery O
even O
understanding O
possible O
complications. O
Plan: O
1. O
Dobutamine O
echocardiogram O
to O
check O

2. O
Recommend O
intravenous O
beta-blockers O
during O
the O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Mr. O
Ogrady O
is O
a O
66-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
is O
coming O
in O
to O
Grafton O
Clinic O
to O
establish O
care O
and O
to O
discuss O
several O
medical O
issues. O
1. O
Pain. O
He O
has O
whole O
body O
pain, O
mostly O
in O
his O
abdomen O
and O
his O
leg, O
and O
this O
has O
been O
longstanding O
for O
2 O
years' O
time. O
Has O
been O
treating O
with O
Percocet O
initially O
at O
about O
3-4 O
per O
day O
but O
most O
recently, O
as O
high O
as O
6 O
per O
day O
and O
in O

6 O
per O

is O
the O
average. O
He O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
pain O
clinic O
and O
was O
started O
on O
Neurontin. O
It O
is O
unclear O
how O
compliant O
he O
has O
been O
with O
that O
regimen. O
Dr. O
Hoover O
has O
been O
renewing O
his O
Percocet O
prescriptions. O
He O
has O
had O
a O
CAT O
scan O
done O
in O
the O
past O
because O
of O
a O
history O
of O
esophageal O
cancer, O
which O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
cancer O
or O
no O
other O
etiology O
for O
his O
pain. O
2. O
Esophageal O

was O
in O
June O
2095 O
that O
showed O
some O
pulmonary O
nodules O
and O
a O
renal O
cyst O
that O
needed O
followup. O
He O
has O
not O
yet O
had O
a O
repeat O
CT O
scan O
that O
was O
scheduled O
for O
yesterday, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
go O
to O
the O
appointment O
because O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
it O
at O
the O
Cancer O
Center O
where O
he O
feels O
more O
relaxed. O
3. O

side. O
He O
says O
he O
has O
been O
having O
increasing O
pain O
over O
the O
last O
several O
years O
on O
that O
side, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
takes O
the O
Percocet. O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
A O
66-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
multiple O
medical O
issues. O
1. O
Diabetes, B-DIABETES
recheck O
hemoglobin O
A1c O
today. O
He O
is O
going O
to O
find O
out O
when O
the O
last O
time O
it O
was O
he O
had O
an O
eye O
exam. O
2. O
Pain. O
He O
has O
had O
this O
pain O
syndrome O
for O
quite O
some O
time. O
He O
is O
on O
short-acting O
narcotic O
and O
I O
think O
this O
is O
appropriate. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
start O
him O
on O
a O
fentanyl O
patch O
25 O
mcg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
and O
decrease O
his O
Percocet O
to O
4 O
per O
day. O
Hopefully, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
wean O
him O
off O
his O
Percocet O
altogether. O
3. O
Esophageal O
cancer. O
Follow O
up O
with O
Dr. O
Yan O
and O
Dr. O
Patton. O
4. O
Pulmonary O
nodule. O
I O
emphasized O
the O
need O
for O
him O
to O
repeat O
his O
CT O
scan. O
I O
sent O
an O
email O
to O
Dr. O
Yan. O
He O
wants O
to O
only O
do O
them O
at O
the O
Cancer O
Center O
and O
that O
is O
where O
last O
films O
were O
done. O
I O
explained O
how O
important O
it O
was. O
4. O
Idiopathic O
thrombocytopenia. O
We O
are O
going O
to O
watch O
this. O
He O
had O
a O
workup O
by O
Dr. O
Sawyer O
in O
the O
past. O
He O
reports O
no O
bleeding. O
5. O
Coronary O
artery O
disease. O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
get O
Dr. O
Landers's O
records O
for O
me, O
especially O
his O
last O
angiogram. O
We O
are O
going O
to O
check O
his O
cholesterol O
today. O
He O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
in O
approximately O
1 O
month's O
time O
to O
reevaluate O
his O
pain. O
6. O
His O
EKG O
today O
shows O
a O
sinus O
rhythm O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
60, O
normal O
intervals, O
normal O
axis, O
and O
poor O
R-wave O
progression O
in O
the O
precordial O
leads O
and O
as O
indicated O
above, O
possible O
septal O
infarct O
and O
possible O
inferior O
infarct. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
a O
baseline O
for O
comparison.4. O

as O
well O
as O
cooking O
and O
preparing O
meals. O
She, O
however, O
is O
requiring O
a O
lot O
of O
assistance O
with O
managing O
her O
medications. O
She O
has O
her O
daughter-in-law O
downstairs O
help O
her O
with O
this. O
She O
has O
not O
been O
out O
of O
the O
house O
much O
in O
the O
last O
several O
months, O
and, O
while O
she O
wants O
to O
drive, O
no-one O
has O
allowed O
her O
to O
get O
behind O
the O
wheel. O
The O
patient O
otherwise O
feels O
well O
with O
no O
chest O
pain, O
no O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
no O
change O
in O
her O
bowel O
or O
bladder. O
HABITS: O
She O
has O
had O
a O
weight O
which O
has O
been O
stable, O
and O
her O
appetite O
has O
been O
good. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
Notable O
for O
a O
well-appearing O
female O
who O
walks O
with O
a O
walker, O
slowly, O
but O
in O
no O
acute O
distress. O
Her O
weight O
is O
104 O
lbs. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
today O
is O
130/72. O
Her O
pulse O
is O

regular O
today. O
She O
has O
no O
peripheral O
edema, O
and O
she O
is O
comfortable O
sitting O
in O
a O
chair. O
IMPRESSION: O
My O
overall O
impression O
is O
that O
Ms. O
Bird O
is O
stable O
with O
her O
current O
regimen O
and O
medications. O

to O
keep O
her O
INR O
between O
2 O
and O

and, O
most O
recently, O
it O
was O
2.5, O
earlier O
this O
week. O
She O
will O
continue O
on O
her O
current O
medications, O
as O
noted O
above. O
The O
bulk O
of O
the O
discussion O
was O
regarding O
her O
home O
situation O
and O
her O
mental O
status. O
She O
has O
clearly O
improved O
her O
mental O
status O
gradually O
over O
the O
last O
several O
months. O
She O
is O
anxious O
to O
drive. O
However, O
everyone O
in O
the O
family O
who O
is O
with O
her O
at O
the O
visit O
and O
her O
visiting O
nurse O
agree O
that O
she O
is O
not O
mentally O
sound O
enough O
to O
be O
behind O
a O
wheel. O
I O
explained O
this O
in O
no O
uncertain O
terms, O
and O
also O
set O
a O
milestone O
in O
management O
of O
her O
own O
medications. O
Hence, O
our O
three O
goals O
that O
we O
set O
today O
were: O
1. O
Management O
of O
the O
patient's O
own O
medications, O
which O
she O
was O
doing O
six O
months O
ago. O
2. O
To O
get O
out O
of O
the O
house O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week, O
using O
either O
community O
transportation O
or O
a O
family O
member. O
3. O
To O
be O
doing O
the O
family's O
laundry O
each O
week. O
While O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
happy O
about O
being O
told O
that O
she O
could O
not O
drive, O
she O
understood O
the O
reasons O
and O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
goals O
that O
we O
set. O
Hence, O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
about O
six O
weeks O
and O
see O
how O
she O
is O
doing O
with O
these O
goals. O
As O
well, O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
have O
the O
visiting O
nurse O
see O
her O
every O
other O
week O
to O
monitor O
her O
blood O
sugar O
and O
Coumadin. O

Her O

I O
suggested O
that O
I O
could O
give O
her O
an O

for O
her O
sciatica, O
but O
I O
would O
rather O
wait O
because O
of O
her O
anticoagulation, O
and O
to O
see O
whether O
it O
remits O
on O
it's O
own. O

Dear O
Dr. O

I O
had O
the O
chance O
today O
to O
see O
Terri O
Bird O
in O
follow-up, O
as O
her O
primary O
care O
physician. O
As O
you O
are O
well O
aware, O
she O

I O
have O

months. O
For O
my O

I O
am O

history O
of O
spinal O
stenosis, O
for O
which O
she O
has O
been O
treated O
intermittently O
with O
epidural O
steroid O
injection. O
About O
a O
year O

she O
had O
an O
abdominal O
aortic O
aneurysm O
repair O
and O
in O
this O
setting O
developed O
some O
delirium O
and O
at O
that O
point O
was O
sent O
to O
rehab O
where O
she O
had O
a O
ankle O
fracture O
and O
a O
long O
recovery O
and O
she O
spent O
time O
at O
several O
different O
nursing O

and O
had O
a O
hip O
fracture O
as O
well O
as O
a O
recurrent O
ankle O
fracture O
and O
most O
recently O
has O
been O
with O
you O
at O

I O
also O
have O

The O
patient O
was O
brought O
to O
me O
today O
by O
her O
family, O
because O
they O
were O
concerned O
that O
she O
was O
not O
getting O
optimal O
care. O
In O
talking O
to O
her, O
she O
says O
she O
feels O
quite O
well. O
She O
has O
no O
pain. O
She O
has O
no O
pain O
in O
her O
buttocks O
or O
her O
legs. O
She O
says O
her O
breathing O
feels O
well. O
She O
has O
no O
productive O
cough. O
She O
has O
no O
chest O
pain. O
She O
denies O
any O
peripheral O
edema. O
She O
notes O
that O
she O
is O
concerned O
that O
she O
is O
not O
getting O
enough O
exercise O
at O
Elm O
Hill O
Nursing O
Home, O
but O
otherwise O
feels O
like O
she O
is O
getting O
reasonable O
care. O
However, O
she O
does O
breakdown O
and O
cry O
about O
her O
current O
situation O
in O
that O
she O
is O
depressed O
about O
living O
in O
a O
nursing O
home. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
the O
exam O
today, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
122/70. O
She O
has O
a O
regular O
rate O
and O
rhythm O
on O
heart O
exam O
with O
a O
pulse O
of O
72. O
She O
has O
sharp O
clicks O
over O
her O
chest. O
She O
has O
a O
soft O
abdomen O
with O
no O
organomegaly O
and O
a O
well O
healed O
scar. O
She O
has O
equal O
pulses O
bilaterally. O
She O
has O
got O
a O
normal O
skin O
exam O
with O
multiple O
skin O
tags. O
She O
has O
a O
full O
range O
of O
motion O
in O
her O
upper O
extremities O
as O
well O
as O
her O
hips, O
knees O
and O
ankles. O
She O
has O
a O
stooped O
gate O
and O
I O
watch O
her O
walk O
with O
her O
walker O
and O
she O
seems O
relatively O
stable. O
She O
is O
somewhat O
confused O
about O
the O
date O
and O
the O
place, O
but O
recognizes O
me O
and O
is O
able O
to O
articulate O
very O
clearly O
about O
her O
current O
situation O
at O
Elm O
Hills. O
I O
have O
no O
laboratory O
data O
to O
speak O
of. O
I O
had O
a O
long O
conversation O
with O
her O
and O
her O
husband O
as O
well O
as O
her O
son O
and O
daughter-in-law O
and O
explained O
my O
concerns O
with O
her O
overall O
safety O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
currently O
it O
would O
be O
unwise O
for O
her O
to O
be O
in O
an O
unsupervised O
setting. O
I O
thought O
that O
a O
nursing O
home O
is O
a O
reasonable O
place O
for O
her O
to O
be O
and O
suggested O
quite O
strongly O
to O
consider O
an O
antidepressant. O
It O
looks O
like O
you O
have O
had O
a O
psychiatrist O
evaluate O
her O
recently O
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
worthwhile, O
at O
least O
a O
month O
trial O
of O
SSRI, O
gradually O
titrating O
up O
the O
dose O
based O
on O
her O
side O
effects. O
I O
am O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
see O
her O
intermittently O
to O
give O
her O
reassurance, O
but O
it O
seems O
like O
your O
care O
has O
been O
excellent O
and O
feel O

History: O
Mr. O
Quijano O
returned O
for O
follow-up O
today. O
His O
last O
visit O
was O
in O
December O
2075, O
following O
which O
he O
had O
a O
routine O
stress O
test. O
He O
had O
been O
planning O
to O
do O
some O
skiing O
over O
January, O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
give O
him O
clearance O
to O
do O
so. O
His O
stress B-CAD
test I-CAD
was I-CAD
done I-CAD
on I-CAD
1-4-76, I-CAD
and I-CAD
revealed I-CAD
mild I-CAD
apical I-CAD
ischemia. I-CAD
He O
completed O
8 O
METs O
and O
had O
no O
symptoms O
during O
the O
test. O
Based O
on O
these O
findings, O
we O
did O
not O
change O
any O
medications O
and O
encouraged O
him O
to O
continue O
with O
his O
usual O
activities. O
Unfortunatley, O
he O
was O
never O
able O
to O
ski O
over O
January O
anyway O
due O
to O
a O
bout O
with O
pneumonia. O
He O
had O
also O
reported O
a O
vague O
sensation O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath O
that O
was O
occurring O
'rarely', O
but O
was O
correlated O
with O
the O
consumption O
of O
alcohol. O
The O
frequency O
of O
these O
episodes O
has O
increased O
to O
2-3 O
times O
per O
week. O
He O
says O
it O
is O
not O
really O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
but O
an O
awareness O
that O
something O
feels O
different. O
He O
is O
able O
to O
continue O
his O
usual O
activities, O
including O
his O
aerobics O
and O
pilates O
classes O
without O
difficulty. O
He O
denies O
any O
chest O
discomfort, O
palpitations, O
rapid O
heart O
action, O
dizziness O

syncope. O

He O
has O
history O
of O
several O
risk O
factors O
and O
a O
history O
of O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
hypercholesterolemia B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
a O
history B-SMOKER
of I-SMOKER
cigarette B-SMOKER
smoking. I-SMOKER
He O
has O
a O
prior O
history O
of O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
with O
a O
known O
abdominal O
aortic O
aneurysm. O
He O
also O
has O
a O
history O
of O
bicuspid O
aortic O
valve O
with O
mild-to-moderate O
stenosis O
on O
recent O
echos O
and O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation. O
He O
is O
status O
post O
a O
posterolateral B-CAD
MI I-CAD
in I-CAD
2084 I-CAD
and O
had O
an O
adenosine O
MIBI O
in O
January O
2097 O
with O
an O
old B-CAD
inferior I-CAD
MI I-CAD
and I-CAD
peri-infarct I-CAD
ischemia. I-CAD
He O
presented O
with O
increasing B-CAD
angina I-CAD
with I-CAD
exertion I-CAD
where O
he O
is O
able O
to O
do O
most O
activities O
and O
climb O
stairs O
and O
walk O
his O
dog, O
but O
does O
have O
about O
one B-CAD
episode I-CAD
of I-CAD
angina I-CAD
a I-CAD
week I-CAD
while O
raking O
leaves O
that O
last O
about O
5 O
minutes O
and O
resolves O
with O
rest. O
He O
has O
not O
had O
any O
rest O
pain. O
For O
his O
increasing O
angina, O
he O
had O
an O
attempted O
cardiac O
catheterization O
done O
last O
month, O
but O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
advance O
the O
guidewire O
pass O
the O
iliac O
artery O
and O
an O
MRI O
was O
able O
to O
determine O
that O
he O
has O
an O
occluded O
aorta. O
He O
then O
had O
a O
left O
brachial O
artery. O
Cardiac O
catheterization O
that O
revealed O
extensive O
coronary O
disease O
with O
a O
70-80% O
distal O
left O
main O
stenosis O
and O
severe O
disease O
of O
the O
LAD O
and O
circumflex O
with O
minimal O

and O
a O
subtotal O
occlusion O
of O
the O
proximal O
right O
coronary O
with O
collateralization O
from O
the O
LAD O
territory. O
There O
was O
an O
anomalous O
circumflex O
that O
appeared O
to O
emerge O
from O
the O
right O
coronary O
and O
there O
was O
a O
question O
of O
his O
anomalus O
LAD O
with O
a O
separate O
ostium O
superior O
to O
the O
left O
main, O
but O
the O
documentation O
of O
this O
was O
not O
clear. O
With O
the O
complexity O
of O
his O
anatomy, O
he O
is O
referred O
for O
further O
evaluation. O
He O
has O
otherwise O
a O
history O
of O
cigarette O
smoking O
and O

border. O
His O
abdomen O
was O
benign. O
Extremities O
showed O
no O

edema, O
but O
very O
faint O
distal O
pulses O
that O
were O
audible O
by O

IMAGING O
STUDIES: O
His O
electrocardiogram O
showed O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
left O
anterior O
fascicular O

and O
was O
otherwise O
unremarkable. O
His O
labs O
showed O
a O

IMPRESSION: O
Mr. O
Ehlers O
presents O
with O
extensive O
vascular O
disease O
including O
left O
main O
and O
three-vessel O
disease. O
We O
will O
try O
and O
define O
better O
his O
actual O
anatomy O
and O
likely O
do O
act O
angiogram O
to O
try O
and O
identify O
the O
locations O
of O
any O
anomalus O
vessels O
and O
then O
have O
a O
surgical O
consults O
regarding O
bypass O
surgery O
for O
his O
left O

extensive O
disease. O
We O
will O
also O
get O
an O

to O
reevaluate O
carefully O
the O
aortic O
valve. O
We O
will O
also O

ASSESSMENT: O
Progressive O
renal O
dysfunction O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
severe O
bilateral O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
for O
consideration O
of O
reno-vascular O
disease. O
PLAN: O
1. O
His O
MRA O
of O
abdomen O
was O
reviewed O
with O
Dr.Quilici, O
BHCC O
IR O
department. O
Aorta O
is O
fully O
occluded O
beneath O
the O
level O
of O
both O
kidneys. O
Tight O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
noted O
in O
both O
kidneys. O
Both O
proximal O
and O
distal O
stenosis O
noted O
in O
the O
Rt O
renal O
artery. O
Both O
kidneys O
appeared O
normal O
in O
size O
11.2 O
and O
11.4 O
cm. O
Dr.Quilici O
is O
confident O
that O
renal O
angioplasty O
could O
be O
done O
relatively O
safely O
through O
radial O
artery O
approach. O
2. O
We O
have O
requested O
Dr.Xi, O
Vascular O
surgeon O
to O
get O
his O
opinon O
on O
the O
need O
for O
surgical O
revascularisation O
of O
feet O
to O
save O
his O
legs O
from O
critical O
ischemia O
in O
the O
future. O
If O
so, O
whether O
he O
would O
benefit O
from O
surgical O
revascularisation O
of O
the O
kidneys. O
We O
are O
awaiting O
his O
expert O
opinion. O
3. O
Patient O
realises O
that O
renal O
angiogram O
+ O
angioplasty O
thro' O
radial O
artery O
carries O
its O
own O
risk. O
Risks O
of O
Cholesterol O
emboli, O
Contrast O
nephropathy, O
arterial O
injury, O
risk O
of O
further O
deterioration O
of O
his O
kidney O
function O
leading O
to O
early O
initiation O
of O
dialysis O
are O
explained. O
However O
patient O
feels O
that O
it O
worth O
taking O
a O
choice O
to O
prevent O
the O
kidneys O
from O
worsening O
rapidly O
by O
attempted O
angiopalsty. O
4. O
We O
will O
obtain O
renal O
ultrasound O
to O
again O
measure O
his O
kidneys O
and O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
obstructive O
uropathy O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
renal O
dysfunction. O
5. O
If O
patient O
is O
going O
for O
IR O
renal O
angiogram/plasty, O
then O
he O
will O
need O
Contrast O
prophylaxis. O
We O
will O
review O
him O
tomorrow O
with O
Dr.Xi's O
opinon. O

His O
options O
are: O
1) O

History O
of O
Present O
Illness: O
This O
70 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
an O
occluded O
distal O
aorta O
in O
mid-2097 O
after O
an O
attempt O
at O
cardiac O
catheterization O
via O
the O
femoral O
artery. O
Over O
the O
last O
several O
months, O
he O
has O
had O
exercise O
limiting O
lower O
extremity O
pain O
he O
describes O
primarily O
left O
leg O
burning O
(thigh, O
calf) O
when O
he O
walks, O
coming O
on O
over O
about O
150 O
yards. O
If O
he O
pushes O
further, O
he O
will O
also O
get O
right O
leg O
burning O
in O
a O
similar O
distribution. O
He O
also O
has O
had O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
CR O
over O
the O
past O
8 O
monts O
(1.1 O
-&gt; O
&gt;4). O
Based O
on O
non-invasive O
imaging, O
this O
has O
been O
attributed O
to O
renal O
artery O
stenosis. O
His O
ACE-I B-MEDICATION
(?ramipril) I-MEDICATION
has I-MEDICATION
been I-MEDICATION
held, I-MEDICATION
without O
improvement. O
A O
referral O
was O
recently O
made O
to O
rule O
out O
bilateral O
RAS, O
and O
he O
had O
an O
invasive O
aortogram O
yesterday. O
There O
was O
an O
85% O
proximal O
right O
RA O
stenosis, O
and O
a O
40% O
left O
RA O
stenosis, O
perhaps O
only O
partially O
explaining O
the O
elevated O
Cr. O
The O
angiogram O
also O
confirmed O
the O
occluded O
distal O
aorta O
(below O
the O
renal O
arteries, O
the O
SMA O
is O
patent). O
An O
aortobifem O
plus O
right O
RA O
revascularization O
is O
planned. O
He O
has O
had O
reduced O
functional O
capacity O
for O
some O
time. O
He O
gets O
claudication O
within O
150 O
yards, O
but O
he O
also O
has O
been O
limited O
by O
exertional O
dyspnea. O
He O
complains O
also O
of O
orthopnea O
(3 O
pillows), O
PND, O
as O
well O
as O
bilateral O
LE O
edema. O
He O
also O
has O
noticed O
his O
weight O
continuing O
to O
creep O
up O
which O
he O
attributes O
to O
fluid O
retention. O
He O
is O
avoiding O
salt, O
but O
not O
fluid O
restricting. O
His O
lasix O
dose O
has O
not O

Plan: O
This O

(CHF) O
and O
hypertensive; O
this O
should O
be O
improved O
prior O
to O
any O

The O
issues O
include: O
Congestive O
heart O
failure O
I O
suspect O
there O
is O
worsening O
fluid O
retention O
primarily O
due O
to O
his O
worsening O
renal O
function. O
I O
would O
consider: O
increasing O
his O
diuretic O
(eg. O
Lasix O

to O
improve O
diuresis O
and O
get O
him O
euvolemic. O
Hopefully O
this O
will O
work; O
if O
not, O
he O
should O
have O
ultrafiltration O
so O
that O
he O
is O
not O
in O
heart O
failure O
for O
his O
operation. O
He O
will O
be O
at O
high O
risk O
of O

Illness: O
This O
73 O

has O
been O
disabled O
assistance O

Dear O
Dr. O
Null, O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Nick O
Hall O
in O
WSH O
cardiology O
clinic O
today O
in O
follow-up O
of O
his O
recent O
admission O
to O
the O
ICMA. O
While O
I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
his O
history, O
please O
allow O
me O
to O
briefly O
review O
it O
for O
my O
records. O
He O
is O
a O
lovely O
53 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
whose O
history O
is O
remarkable O
for O
Hodgkins, O
status O
post O
mantle O
radiation O
in O
the O
early O
70's; O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
status B-CAD
post-PCI B-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
and I-CAD
RCA I-CAD
in O
'90 O
and O
'87, O
respectively, O
and O
recently O
diagnosed O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer. O
MIBI B-CAD
done O
at O
LMC O
1/24/94 O
showed O
normal O
EF O
without O
perfusion O
defects O
(no O
scar O
or O
ischemia); O
he O
exercised O
10:30 O
on O
a O
standard O
Bruce O
iwthout O
symptoms. O
He O
was O
admitted O
2/94 O
for O
elective O
left O
upper O
lobectomy O
for O
his O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer O
(ASA B-MEDICATION
was O
stopped O
1 O
week O
prior O
to O
surgery; O
he O
was O
not O
on O
plavix B-MEDICATION
preop); O
in O
PACU O
following O
resection, O
he O
had O
a O
VT/VF O
arrest O
and O
was O
taken O
emergently O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
lab, O
where O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
massive B-CAD
volume I-CAD
of I-CAD
thrombus I-CAD
extending I-CAD
throughout I-CAD
his I-CAD
RCA. I-CAD
After O
extensive O
suction O
catheter O
use O
and O
POBA, B-CAD
a O
good O
angiographic O
result O
was O
obtained; O
no O
stents O
were O
placed O
due O
to O
the O
heightened O
thrombotic O
state O
that O
he O
was O
in. O
Remarkably, O
echocardiogram O
revealed O
normal O
LV O
systolic O
function, O
with O
basal O
inferoposterior O
HK O
noted. O
His O
peak O
TnI O
was O
33.6, O
his O
peak O
CK O
was O
1710, O
and O
his O
peak O
MB O
was O
87.2. O
He O
had O
a O
relatively O
unremarkable O
course O
post-catheterization; O
plavix O
initiation O
was O
delayed O
until O
his O
chest O
tube O
was O
removed, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
started O
without O
incident. O
He O
was O
discharged O
2/11/94, O
and O
returns O
today O
for O
routine O
follow-up. O
Regarding O
his O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer, O
it O
is O
my O
understanding O
that O
he O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
metastatic O
disease O
and O
that O
margins O
were O
negative; O
he O
is O
not O
currently O
planned O
for O
any O
adjuvant O
therapy, O
but O
will O
be O
closely O
followed. O
Regarding O
his O
remote O
history O
of O
Hodgkins, O
he O
is O
followed O
at O
RFPC, O
and O
is O
due O
for O
an O
annual O
visit O
there O
in O
the O
next O
1-2 O
months. O
He O
has O
been O
walking O
outside O
for O
the O
past O
~2 O
weeks O
(since O
the O
weather O
improved), O
walking O
about O
2 O
miles O
in O
around O
30 O
minutes. O
He O
feels O
well, O
and O
has O
had O
no O
problems. O
He O
notes O
some O
mild O
dyspnea O
with O
increased O
exertion O
(climbing O
hills), O
but O
denies O
any O
unusual O
dyspnea. O
He O
denies O
chest O
pain, O
SOB O
at O
rest, O
orthopnea O
(stable O

PND, O

In O
summary, O
this O
is O
a O
53 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
had O
a O
VF O
arrest O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
perioperative O
inferior O
STEMI, O
status O
post O
extensive O
angiojet O
and O
POBA O
of O
acute O
in-stent O
thrombosis O
of O
presumed O
bare O
metal O
stents O
in O
his O
RCA. O
He O
is O
asymptomatic O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
standpoint, O
and O
somewhat O
remarkably O
did O
not O
take O
a O
large O
myocardial O
hit O
from O
this O
life-threatening O
event. O
Our O
attention O
now O
shifts O
to O
the O
prevention O
of O
future O
events. O
Given O
the O
degree O
of O
thrombus O
burden O
in O
his O
RCA O
at O
the O
time O
of O
cath, O
he O
is O
someone O
for O
whom O
we O
would O
strongly O
advise O
lifelong O
plavix O
and O
aspirin. O
Furthermore, O
he O
is O
not O
someone O
for O
whom O
I O
would O
be O
comfortable O
with O
even O
temporary O
discontinuation O
of O
one O
of O
these O
agents O
- O
we O
would O
advise O
that O
ANY O
future O
procedures O
be O
done O
on O
aspirin O
and O
plavix. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
are O
well O
controlled O
on O
his O
current O
regimen, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
his O
home O
records. O
I O
have O
taken O
the O
liberty O
today O
of O
changing B-MEDICATION
him I-MEDICATION
from I-MEDICATION
lopressor I-MEDICATION
200 I-MEDICATION
bid I-MEDICATION
to I-MEDICATION
toprol B-MEDICATION
200 O
bid O
to O
minimize O
any O
ups O
and O
downs O
in O
his O
beta O
blockade, O
but O
otherwise, O
would O
not O
make O
any O
changes O
to O
his O
regimen O
at O
this O
time. O
We O
will O
check O
a O
full O
set O
of O
labs O
today, O
but O
I O
suspect O
that O
no O
further O
changes O
will O
be O
required O
at O
this O
time. O
Given O
his O
history O
of O
Hodgkin's, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
known O
CAD, O
he O
is O
clearly O
at O
risk O
for O
future O
events, O
and O
I O
suspect O
that O
we O
will O
take O
a O
rather O
aggressive O
stance O
in O
terms O
of O
monitoring O
for O
ischemia. O
Certainly, O
if O
he O
has O
any O
concerning O
symptoms, O
we O
would O
have O
a O
low O
threshold O
to O
pursue O
an O
aggressive O
course. O
At O
present, O
however, O
I O
am O
delighted O
with O
how O
well O
he O
is O
doing. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Hall O
in O
cardiology O
clinic O
today. O
I O
will O
plan O
to O
see O
him O
in O
follow-up O
in O
6 O
months O
time, O
but O
he O
knows O
to O
call O
sooner O
should O
he O
have O
any O
problems O
or O
concerns. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Null, O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Nick O
Hall O
in O
WSH O
cardiology O
clinic O
today O
in O
follow-up O
for O
his O
known O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
and O
recent O
admission O
to O
Wytheville O
South O
with O
a O
non-ST B-CAD
elevation I-CAD
myocardial B-CAD
infarction. I-CAD
As O
I'm O
sure O
you O
recall, O
he O
is O
a O
lovely O
54 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
whose O
history O
of O
Hodgkins O
disease O
status-post O
mantle O
radiation O
in O
the O
early O
70's, O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer O
status O
post O
left O
upper O
lobectomy O
1/94, O
and O
coronary O
artery O
disease, O
status B-CAD
post-PCI I-CAD
to I-CAD
the I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
and I-CAD
RCA I-CAD
in I-CAD
'90 I-CAD
and I-CAD
'87, I-CAD
respectively, I-CAD
and O
perioperative O
VT/VF O
arrest O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
LUL O
resection O
1/94. O
At O
that O
time, O
emergent B-CAD
catheterization I-CAD
revealed O
massive O
volume O
of O
thrombus O
extending O
throughout O
his O
RCA, O
managed O
with O
extensive O
suction O
catheter O
use O
and O
POBA, B-CAD
with O
a O
good O
angiographic O
result. O
No O
stents B-CAD
were O
placed O
given O
the O
thrombus O
burden. O
Remarkably, O
subsequent O
echocardiogram O
revealed O
normal O
LV O
systolic O
function, O
with O
basal O
inferoposterior O
HK O
noted. O
His O
peak B-CAD
TnI I-CAD
was I-CAD
33.6, I-CAD
his O
peak O
CK O
was O
1710, O
and O
his O
peak O
MB O
was O
87.2. O
He O
had O
a O
relatively O
unremarkable O
course O
post-catheterization; O
plavix B-MEDICATION
initiation O
was O
delayed O
until O
his O
chest O
tube O
was O
removed, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
started O
without O
incident. O
He O
was O
discharged O
2/11/94, O
and O
had O
done O
well O
until O
1/31/2095, O
when O
he O
presented O
to O
WSH O
with O
unstable B-CAD
angina, B-CAD
having O
noted O
new O
sudden O
onset O
angina O
and O
dyspnea O
while O
making O
his O
daily O
walk. O
He O
had O
a O
positive O
troponin, O
and O
was O
taken O
urgently O
to O
cardiac B-CAD
catheterization, I-CAD
which I-CAD
revealed I-CAD
a I-CAD
proximal I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
lesion I-CAD
(felt I-CAD
to I-CAD
be I-CAD
the I-CAD
culprit) I-CAD
and I-CAD
ostial I-CAD
RCA I-CAD
lesion, I-CAD
both O
of O
which O
were O
stented B-CAD
with I-CAD
CYPHER I-CAD
stents. I-CAD
At O
that O
time O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
increase O
his O
plavix O
from O
75 O
to O
150 O
as O
an O
attempt O
to O
maximize O
his O
medical O
management, O
given O
his O
history O
and O
disease O
burden. O
Since O
that O
admission, O
he O
has O
done O
exceedingly O
well, O
and O
presents O
today O
without O
complaints. O
He O
continues O
to O
walk O
2 O
miles O
~4 O
times/week O
without O
exertional O
symptoms. O
He O
specifically O
denies O
chest O
pain, O
dyspnea, O
orthopnea, O
PND, O
or O
lower O
extremity O
edema. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
palpitations, O
dizziness/presyncope, O
or O
claudication. O
He O
has O
significantly O
modified O
his O
diet O
to O
eliminate O
dairy O
and O
hydrogenated O
products/snacks, O
with O
a O
5# O
weight O
loss, O
and O
is O
motivated O
to O
further O
reduce O
his O
weight. O
He O
states O
that O
he O
feels O
'great' O
and O
isdoing O
quite O
well. O
He O
does O
not O
that O
occasionally O
at O
this O
work, O
when O
he O
is O
frustrated/upset, O
he O
will O
take O
his O
pressure O
and O
find O
his O
systolic O
to O
be O
~150, O
but O
this O
comes O
down O
within O
minutes O
if O
he O
relaxes, O
and O
his O
pressures O
are O
great O
at O
home. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
GI O
symptoms O
on O
the O
aggressive O
antiplatelet O
regimen, O
despite O
not O
being O
on O
a O
PPI. O
Regarding O
his O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
cancer, O
it O
is O
my O
understanding O
that O
he O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
metastatic O
disease O
and O
that O
margins O
were O
negative; O
he O
is O
not O
currently O
planned O
for O
any O
adjuvant O
therapy, O
but O
will O
be O
closely O
followed. O
His O
most O
recent O
imaging O
was O
11/94, O
which O
was O
negative O
for O
evidence O
of O
metastasis O
by O
repor. O
Regarding O
his O
remote O
history O
of O
Hodgkins, O
he O
is O
followed O
at O
RFPC O
on O
an O
annual O
basis. O
His O

of O
75 O
and O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O

He O
is O
a O

gentleman O
in O
no O

His O
JVP O
is O
~7-8 O

he O
has O
no O
carotid O

His O
lungs O
are O
clear O
to O

His O
EKG O
in O
clinic O
today O
is O
NSR O
at O
75 O
with O
possible O
left O
atrial O
abnormality, O
a O
nonspeciifc O
IVCD, O
and O
inferior O
Q O
waves O
in O
III/F, O
consistent O
with O
an O
inferior O
MI. O
In O
summary, O
this O
is O
a O
54 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
had O
a O
VF O
arrest O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
perioperative O
inferior O
STEMI, O
status O
post O
extensive O
angiojet O
and O
POBA O
of O
acute O
in-stent O
thrombosis O
of O
presumed O
bare O
metal O
stents O
in O
his O
RCA, O
who O
represented O
1 O
year O
later O
(1/95) O
with O
NSTEMI O
now O
s/p O
PCI O
to O
his O
RCA O
and O
LAD. O
He O
is O
now O
asymptomatic O
status O
post O
this O
intervention O
Given O
his O
history, O
we O
agree O
with O
antiplatelet O
therapy, O
with O
a O
plan O
for O
lifelong O
plavix O
and O
aspirin. O
Should O
he O
require O
future O
invasive O
diagnostic O
procedures, O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
decrease O
doses O
to O
75 O
plavix/81 O
ASA, O
but O
we O
would O
not O
favor O
DC O
of O
either O
of O
these O
medications O
altogether. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
are O
well O
controlled O
on O
his O
current O
regimen, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
his O
home O
records. O
His O
LDL O
is O
near O
goal, O
with O
a O
low O
HDL O
that O
was O
unaffected O
by O
high-dose O
niaspan O
in O
the O
past. O
I O
share O
his O
hope O
that O
with O
further O
diet/weight O
loss O
and O
exercise, O
these O
will O
both O
improve O
to O
goal. O
As O
I O
have O
discussed O
with O
he O
and O
his O
wife, O
given O
his O
history O
of O
Hodgkin's, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
known O
CAD, O
he O
is O
clearly O
at O
risk O
for O
future O
events, O
including O
the O
possibility O
of O
bypass O
surgery O
in O
the O
future. O
We O
will O
be O
guided O
by O
his O
symptoms, O
and O
he O
knows O
to O
call O
me O
if O
he O
has O
any O
problems/symptoms. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Hall O
in O
cardiology O
clinic O
today. O
I O
will O
plan O
to O
see O
him O
in O
follow-up O
in O
6 O
months O
time, O
but O
he O
knows O
to O
call O
sooner O
should O
he O
have O
any O
problems O
or O
concerns. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Nick O
Hall O
again O
in O
the O
Cardiology O
clinic O
at O
Wytheville O
South O
Hospital O
in O
followup O
of O
his O
post O
myocardial B-CAD
infarction I-CAD
care. O
As O
you O
are O
well O
aware, O
he O
has O
many O
coronary O
risk O
factors. O
He O
is O
a O
55-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
past O
history O
Hodgkin's O
disease, O
status O
post O
mantle O
radiation O
in O
the O
early O

in O
2094 O
for O
early O
stage O
squamous O

lung O
cancer O
that O
was O
complicated O
by O
VT/VF O

hypercholesterolemia, B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
as O
well O
as O
overweight. O
He O
does O
not O
have O
a O

his O
hemoglobin B-DIABETES
A1c I-DIABETES
has I-DIABETES
been I-DIABETES
elevated I-DIABETES
at I-DIABETES
8%. I-DIABETES
His O
prior B-CAD
history I-CAD
of I-CAD
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
dates I-CAD
back I-CAD
to I-CAD
2087 I-CAD
and I-CAD
2090 I-CAD
when I-CAD
he I-CAD
had I-CAD
non-ST I-CAD
elevation I-CAD
MI I-CAD
and I-CAD
coronary B-CAD
interventions I-CAD
to I-CAD
his I-CAD
LAD I-CAD
and I-CAD
RCA. I-CAD
He O
has O
subsequently O
had O
a O
VT/VF O
arrest O
during O
his O
lobectomy O
in O
2094, O
which O
required O
emergent O
coronary O
angiographic O
resuscitation O
where O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
massive O
thrombus O
throughout O
his O
right O
coronary O
artery O
that O
required O
thrombectomy O
and O
POBA B-CAD
with O
good O
results. O
He O
remarkably O
has O
had O
a O
preserved O
LV O
function O
after O
all O
of O
these O
infarctions O
with O
only O
some O
basal O
inferoposterior O
hypokinesis. O
In O
01/2095, O
he O
developed O
recurrent O
exertional O
and O
then O
unstable O
angina, O
presented O
to O
Wytheville O
Sanitarium O
Hospital O
Emergency O
where O
he O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
high O
risk O
acute O
coronary O
artery O
syndrome O
with O
positive O
troponins O
and O
proceeded O
to O
the O
catheterization O
clinic O
where O
he O
again O
had O
proximal O
LAD O
and O
RCA O
occlusions, O
both O
which O
were O
intervened O
with O
drug-eluting O
Cypher O
stents B-CAD
with O
good O
results. O
Since O
then, O
he O
has O
been O
doing O
well O
and O
has O
been O
instructed O
to O
be O

today, O
and O
again, O
he O
has O
no O
limitations O
in O
his O
exertional O
capacity. O
Work O
has O
been O
tough O
in O

and O
will O
find O
out O
soon O
whether O
he O
can O
quit O
his O
evening O

and O
will O
be O
able O
to O
increase O
his O
exercise O
capacity O
such O
that O
he O
will O
be O

I O
think O
it O
is O
time O
to O
start O
an O
ACE B-MEDICATION
inhibitor I-MEDICATION
as O
we O
have O
discussed O
previously. O
We O
started B-MEDICATION
him I-MEDICATION
on I-MEDICATION
ramipril B-MEDICATION
2.5 I-MEDICATION
mg I-MEDICATION
today I-MEDICATION
and O
he O
will O
increase O
that O
to O
5 O
mg O
a O
day O
after O
tolerating O
it O
for O
2 O
weeks. O
He O
will O
take O
his O
blood O
pressures O
at O
home O
few O
times O
a O
week. O
To O
simplify O
and O
decrease O
his O
beta-blocker O
regimen O
we O
switched B-MEDICATION
to I-MEDICATION
atenolol B-MEDICATION
100mg O
daily O
today. O
We O
also O
discussed O
increasing O
his O
lipid O
management O
by O
adding O
niacin B-MEDICATION
again O
starting O
at O
500 O
mg O
extended O
release O
for O
a O
month O
and O
then O
he O
will O
increase O
that O
to O
1 O
g O
a O
day. O
He O
was O
cautioned O
on O
the O
adverse O
potential O
reactions O
of O
facial O
flushing O
and O
headache O
and O
he O
was O
instructed O
to O
take O
his O
aspirin O
325 O
about O
30 O
minute O
prior O
to O
his O
niacin O
to O
minimize O
these O
potential O
side O
effects. O
With O
regards O
to O
his O
coronary O
artery O
disease, O
all O
this O
time O
we O
have O
assumed O
that O
his O
atherosclerosis O
has O
been O
secondary O
to O
high O
dose O
radiation O
exposure O
when O
he O
was O
a O
child. O
Nevertheless, O
Dr. O
Turner O
had O
a O
great O
suggestion O
that O
we O
screen O
him O
for O
quantitative O
platelet O
function O
inhibition, O
given O
we O
recently O
started O
performing O
this O
test O
at O
WSH O
and O
previously O
had O
recurrence O
on O
normal O
strength O
doses O
of O
clopidogrel O
and O
aspirin. O
The O
results O
may O
not O
changes O
our O
current O
management O
strategy, O
but O
it O
may O
give O
us O
insight O
into O
his O
premature O
CAD O
etiology, O
particularly O
coronary O
artery O
thrombus, O
as O
well O
as O
play O
a O
future O
role O
in O
familial O
screening. O
To O
that O
end, O
we O
have O
requested O
light O
transmission O
aggregometry O
for O
platelet O
function O
inhibition. O
We O
have O
also O
requested O
a O
thrombophilia O
workup, O
including O
factor O
V O
Leiden, O
prothrombin O
gene O
mutation, O
protein O
C O
and O
S O
levels, O
antithrombin O
level O
and O
homocysteine O
and O
CRP O
today. O
Otherwise, O
I O
believe O
Nick O
is O
doing O
well. O
We O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
6 O
months' O
time O
with O
follow O
up O
on O
these O
studies. O
If O
by O
then O
he O
still O
has O
evidence O
of O
diabetes, O
and O
trouble O
losing O
weight, O
we O
will O
refer O
him O
to O
our O
nutritionist O
for O
counseling O
and O
refer O
him O
to O
hadley O
memorial O
hospital. O
He O
may O
need O
a O
structured O
monitored O
exercise O
program O
in O
order O
to O
help O
improve O
his O
exercise O
capacity. O
This O
patient O
was O
discussed O
with O
Dr. O
Turner O
in O
clinic. O
Yours O
sincerely, O

Dear O
Dr. O
Nall: O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Nick O
again O
in O
the O
Internal O
Medicine O
at O
Wytheville O
South O
Hospital O
on O
06/14/2098 O
for O
routine O
folow O
up O
of O
radiation O
associated O
ischemic O
heart O
disease. O
As O
you O
know, O
Nick O
had O
mantle O
radiation O
in O
his O
youth O
for O
Hodgkin's O
lymphoma, O
and O
subsequently O
had O
2 B-CAD
NSTEMIs I-CAD
in I-CAD
2087 I-CAD
and I-CAD
2090. I-CAD
He O
received O
bare-metal O
stents B-CAD
to O
his O
LAD O
and O
RCA O
and O
did O
well O
until O
2094 O
when O
after O
diagnosis O
and O
resection O
of O
a O
squamous O
cell O
lung O
carcinoma, O
his O
postop O
course O
was O
immediately O
complicated O
by O
an O
acute B-CAD
inferior B-CAD
STEMI/VT/VF I-CAD
arrest. I-CAD
Immediate O
angiography O
post-resuscitation O
found O
massive O
thrombus O
burden O
in O
his O
proximal O
right O
coronary O
artery, O
with O
good O
result O
after O
thrombectomy B-CAD
and O
POBA, B-CAD
in O
addition O
to O
Integrilin, O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
Plavix, O
and O
low O

heparin. O
Remarkably, O
after O
an O
IABP O
and O
aggressive O
care O
Nick O
walked O
away O
with O
a O
preserved O
LV O
function O
after O
this O
event. O
He O
did O
well O
until O
01/2095 B-CAD
when I-CAD
he I-CAD
represented I-CAD
with I-CAD
unstable I-CAD
angina B-CAD
and O
was O
found O
to O
have O
in-stent O
restenosis O
in O
the O
ostial O
LAD O
and O
the O
ostial O
RCA O
bare-metal O
stents. O
He O
was O
treated O
with O
Cypher O

both O

(3.5 O

extending O
slightly O
into O
the O

of O

with O
no O
residual O
stenosis. O
Because O
of O
concerns O
with O
regards O
to O
recurrent O
in-stent O
restenosis O
he O
was O
put O
on O
dual O
antiplatelet O
therapy O
(325mg O
ECASA O
and O
clopidogrel B-MEDICATION
150 O
mg) O
since O
that O
event O
intended O
as O
longterm O
therapy. O
He O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
me O
since O
2095 O
with O
no O
recurrent O
ischemic O
heart O
disease, O
chest O
pain, O
and O
has O
returned O
to O
normal O
exercise O
capacity O
and O
with O
preserved O
cardiac O
systolic O
function. O
Nick O
continues O
to O
be O
very O
successful O
as O
a O
technology O
consultant O
in O
IBM O
research O
in O
Leland. O
As O
the O
economy O
is O
picking O
up, O
his O
work O
environment O
has O
improved O
as O
has O
his O
stress O
level. O
He O
is O
walking O
every O
day O
both O
at O
work O
and O
recreationally O
and O
lost O
another O
5pounds. O
He O
takes O
his O
medications O
regularly O
and O
is O
usually O
compliant O
but O
ran O
out O
of O
atenolol B-MEDICATION
last O
week O
and O
instead O
has O
been O
taking O
bid O
ramipril B-MEDICATION
in O
its O
place. O
Every O
year O
he O
asks O
whether O
we O
can O
down-titrate O
his O
clopidogrel O
both O
for O
tolerance O
and O
cost O
reasons O
(I O
reassured O
him O
that O
it O
should O
be O
generic O
within O
a O
year). O
Nevertheless, O
we O
tested O
the O
degree O
of O
platelet O
inhibition O
he O
currently O
has O
with O
the O

is O
below O
the O

thought O
to O
approximate O

had O
some O

most O
recently O
in O

due O
to O
accelerated O

To O
target O
his O
coronary O
risk O
factors, O
I O
recommended O
the O
following: O
1. O
Should O
his O
LDL O
be O
&gt;70mg/dL O
he O
should O
switch B-MEDICATION
to I-MEDICATION
rosuvastatin B-MEDICATION
40mg O
daily O
for O
LDL O
and O
HDL O
improvement. O
2. O
Given O
clopidorel O
platelet O
reactivity O
is O
less O
than O
230 O
PRU O
he O
will O
decrease O
to O
75 O
mg O
daily O
and O
we O
will O
re-check O
his O
PRU O
activity O
after O
at O
least O
7 O
days O
on O
this O
dose. O
Should O
PRU O
&gt; O
230 O
he O
will O
either O
need O
to O
restart O
150 O
mg O
daily O
and O
take O
a O
PPI O
like O
pantoprazole O
or O
switch B-MEDICATION
to I-MEDICATION
prasugrel I-MEDICATION
(or O
when O
available O
ticagrelor). O
3. O
He O
will O
continue O
a O
healthy O
heart O
diet O
and O
exercise O
and O
we O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
6 O
months. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
his O
care. O
As O
I O
am O
not O
continuing O
a O

who O
can O
accomodate O
his O

As O
the O
responsible O
teaching O
attending, O
I O
can O
confirm O
both O
the O
history O
and O
physical O
examination O
of O
Dr. O
Uriel O
Zapien. O
Briefly, O
the O
patient O
is O
a O
71-year-old O
female O
with O
several O
cardiovascular O
risk O
factors. O
She O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
in O
January O
after O
a O
prolonged O
episode O
of O
palpitations. O
The O
patient O
had O
a O
tiny O
Troponin O
elevation O
to O
0.3, O
and O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
manage O
her O
conservatively. O
The O
patient O
continues O
to O
have O
these O
episodes O
of O
palpitations, O
but O
she O
does O
not O
get O
chest O
pain O
with O
any O
exercise. O
Her O
current O
medical O
regimen O
includes O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
beta-blocker, B-MEDICATION
statin B-MEDICATION
and O
an O
ACE B-MEDICATION
Inhibitor. I-MEDICATION
On O
physical O
examination O
she O
has O
2+ O
carotids, O
which O
have O
normal O
upstrokes O
and O
no O
bruits. O
Her O
lungs O
are O
clear O
to O
auscultation. O
Her O
heart O
examination O
reveals O
a O
regular O
rate O
with O
a O
normal O
S1 O
and O
S2, O
without O
S3 O
and O
S4. O
Her O
electrocardiogram O
is O
normal. O
Assessment: O
I O
concur O
with O
Dr. O
Zapien O
in O
that O
we O
will O
increase O
the O
patient's O
beta-blockers O
to O
decrease O
her O
probable O
supraventricular O
tachycardia. O
She O
will O
be O
seen O
back O
here O
in O
several O
months. O

Dear O
Dr. O

We O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O
Cora O
Quinley O
in O
followup O
today O
in O
the O
Cardiology O
clinic. O
As O
you O
know, O
she O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
72-year-old O
woman O
with O
diabetes, B-DIABETES

preserved O
left O
ventricular O
function O
(EF O

on O

as O
well O
as O
paroxysmal O
supraventricular O
tachycardia. O
She O
last O
saw O
me O
in O
clinic O
in O
03/2077, O
and O
missed O
several O
followup O
appointments O
in O
part O
because O
she O
spends O
much O
of O
her O
time O
in O
Oregon. O
Over O
the O
past O
year O
and O
several O
months, O
Ms. O
Quinley O
has O
been O
doing O
quite O
well. O
She O
states O
that O
she O
has O
episodes O
of O
palpitations O
approximately O
every O
2 O
months, O
lasting O
less O
then O
5 O
minutes. O
She O
notes O
a O
sensation O
of O
fluttering O
in O
her O
chest, O
with O
no O
chest O
tightness, O
no O
dyspnea, O
no O
lightheadedness, O
no O
syncope. O
She O
denies O
PND, O
orthopnea, O
or O
angina. O
Unfortunately, O
Ms. O
Quinley O
continues O
to O
smoke, O
but O
is O
actively O
interested O
in O
quitting. O
She O
states O
that O
she O
is O
planning O
to O
enroll O
in O
the O
Stonybrook O
Smoking O

On O

she O
is O

appearing O
today O
in O
no O

Blood O

is O

Abdomen O
is O

with O
no O

Pulse O
examination O
is O
normal. O
Recent O

from O
03/2078 O
reveals O
a O
LDL B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
of I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
150. I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA

In O
summary, O
Ms. O
Quinley O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
Her O
palpitations O
and O
likely O
SVT O
are O
occuring O
at O
a O
frequency O
that O
Ms. O
Quinley O
feels O
are O
quite O
acceptable O
for O
her. O
Therefore, O
she O
wishes O
no O
consideration O
of O
possible O
interventions O
or O
changes O
in O
her O
medical O
regimen. O
She O
has O
no O
symptoms O
to O
suggest O
current O
coronary O
ischemia. O
Regarding O
her O
cardiovascular O
risk O
factors, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
reasonably O
well O
controlled O
today, O
and O
you O
are O
actively O
managing O
her O
diabetes. O
However, O
her O
lipid O
profile O
demonstrates O
an O
elevated O
LDL. O
Therefore, O
I O
have O
taken O
liberty O
of O
increasing O
her O
Lipitor O
to O
40 O
mg O
q.h.s. O
I O
plan O
to O
see O
Ms. O
Quinley O
in O
followup O
in O
approximately O
6 O
months. O
Please O
feel O
free O
to O
contact O
me O
otherwise O
regarding O
her O
cardiovascular O
issues. O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
referring O
this O
very O
pleasant O
woman O
for O

He O
was O
brought O
to O
BMH O
where O
he O
indicated O
he O
had O
had O
2 O
similar O

in O

Concern O
for O

He O
ruled O

Cardiology O
was O
therefore O
consulted. O
An O

was I-CAD
later I-CAD
performed I-CAD
and I-CAD
revealed I-CAD
mild B-CAD
inf. I-CAD

The O
patient O
also O
underwent O
an O

study O
that O
was O
non-diagnostic. O
An O

neurology O
consult O
thought O
these O
findings O
were O
unlikely O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
syncope O
and O
agreed O
with O
continued O
evaluation O
of O
cardiac O
etiologies. O
In O
hospital, O
was O
noted O
that O
pt O
had O
had O
40 O
lb O
weight O
loss O
over O
previous O
months. O
Surgery O
was O
consulted O
regarding O
prompt O
need O
for O
intervention O
of O
a O
known O
hernia, O
their O
evaluation O
was O
that O
the O
hernia O
was O
benign O
without O
signs O
of O
obstruction O
and O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
inpatient O
intervention. O
Endocrine O
w/u O
included O
nl O
TSH O
and O
cortstim. O
The O
patient O
had O
had O
a O
recent O
Chest O
and O
Abd O
CT O
and O
colonoscopy O
that O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
pancreatic O
or O
colonic O
massess. O
SPEP O
and O
BNP O
wnl O
and; O
his O
PSA O
was O
elevated O
at O
9.56, O
however O
alk O
phos, O
bone O
survey, O
bone O
scan O
were O
all O
normal. O
The O
patient's O
nutrition O
and O
PO O
intake O
improved O
greatly O
s/p O
treatment O
for O
constipation O
with O
an O
aggressive O
bowel O
regimen. O
Just O
prior O
to O
d/c, O
after O
returning O
from O
an O
uncomplicated O
EP O
study O
the O
patient O
started O
to O
exhibit O
inappropriate O
behavior O
(showing O
stool O
when O
not O
requested O
to O
staff) O
and O
stating O
bizarre O
thoughts O
('I O
lost O
my O
mortal O
soul'). O
Psychiatry O
was O
consulted O
and O
suspected O
the O
patient O
was O
having O
a O
psychotic O
episode O
in O
setting O
of O
prolonged O
hospitalization O
and O
multiple O
diagnostic O
interventions. O
It O
was O
concluded O
that O
an O
inpatient O
geri-psych O
hospitalization O
was O
required. O
Hospitalization O
done O
on O
Psych O
floor. O
Per O
psych O
eval, O
pt O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
and O
depressed O
for O
8 O
months O
with O
poor O
sleep, O
anhedonia, O
and O
decreased O
energy. O
The O
pt O
believed O
that O
he O
had O
died O
some O
time O
ago O
and O
was O
currently O
in O
hell. O
He O
stated O
that O
he O
had O
been O
feeling O
that O
he O
had O
sinned O
so O
horribly, O
that O
God O
could O
not O
forgive O
him. O
He O
stated O
that O
he O
had O
died, O
and O
then O
further O
stated O
that O
by O
this O
he O
meant O
that O
though O
he O
might O
be O
physically O
alive, O
because O
he O
could O
not O
be O
forgiven, O
he O
was O
for O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes, O
spiritually O
dead. O
He O
had O
been O
having O
vivid O
dreams O
and O
had O
been O
told O
that O
he O
had O
exalted O
himself O
above O
god O
and O
for O
that O
would O
be O
punished. O
On O
the O
inpt O
ward, O
Mr. O
Shepherd O
was O
started O
on O
zyprexa O
5 O
mg O
which O
was O
titrated O
up O
to O
a O
dose O
of O
20 O
mg O
qHS. O
Cymbalta O
was O
initiated O
and O
titrated O
up O
to O
60mg O
qDay O
with O
gradual O
and O
signficant O
improvement O
in O
his O
mood. O
The O
patient O
also O
expressed O
difficulty O
sleeping O
which O
responded O
to O
Remeron O
15mg. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge, O
the O
patient O
reported O
good O
appetite, O
adequate O
sleep O
(about O
8 O
hours O
a O
night, O
occasional O
awakening O
with O
nocturia), O
and O
significant O
improvement O
of O
his O
depression. O
He O
further O
noted O
that O
his O
thoughts O
of O
being O
doomed O
to O
hell O
were O
still O
occasionally O
present, O
though O
much O
less O
intense O
than O
upon O
admission, O
and O
he O
reported O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
challenge O
this O
belief O
'most O
of O
the O
time. O
Neuropsych O
testing O
performed O
during O
inpt O
stay O
showing O
significant O
cognitive O
impairment. O
He O
had O
global O
deficits O
in O
language, O
memory, O
visual-spatial O
abilities, O
executive O
functioning, O
and O
attention. O
He O
had O
very O
poor O
learning O
of O

Pt O
was O
discharged O
to O
home O
with O
an O
intake O
appointment O
in O
the O

To O
summarize, O
in O
June, O
the O
patient O
was O
admitted O
after O
experiencing O
several O
syncopal O
episodes. O
They O
were O
associated O
with O
a O
prodrome O
of O
lightheadedness O
and O
weakness O
that O
sometimes O
occurred O
with O
positional O
changes O
and O
at O
other O
times O
at O
rest. O
He O
denied O
associated O
chest O
pain, O
palpitations, O
diaphoresis, O
vertigo, O
focal O
neurologic O
weakness, O
dysphagia, O
diplopia O
or O
blurry O
vision O
occur O
during O
the O
episodes. O
These O
spells O
lasted O
about O
4-5 O
minutes O
and O
there O
were O
no O
incontinence, O
post-ictal O
symptoms, O
or O
tonic-clonic O
movements. O
His O
workup O
included O
a O
surface O
echocardiogram O
that O
showed O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
59% O

During O
his O
admission, O
his O
telemetry O
showed O
a O
twelve O
beat O
run O
of O
non-sustained O
ventricular O
tachycardia O
and O
so O
the O
electrophysiology O

He O
underwent O
an O

Today, O
he O
presents O
with O
no O
acute O

He O
denies O
chest O
pain, O
dyspnea, O
or O
palpitations. O
He O
s O
had O
no O
further O
fainting O
spells O
and O
reports O
that O
his O
last O
REVEAL O
interrogation O
was O
unremarkable. O
His O
claudication O
is O
at O
his O
baseline. O
He O
walks O
at O

Dear O
Dr. O
Townsend: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Nancy O
Xayarath O
today O
with O
regards O
to O
callus O
formation O
over O
the O
plantar O
aspect O
of O
her O
left O
foot. O
As O
you O
are O
aware, O
she O
is O
a O
57-year-old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
insulin-dependent B-DIABETES
diabetes I-DIABETES
mellitus I-DIABETES
and O
Charcot O
arthropathy O
of O
her O
left O
foot O
that O
has O
resulted O
in O
a O
rocker O
bottom O
deformity. O
She O
currently O
wears O
accommodative O
orthotics O
typical O
for O
somebody O
with O
her O
deformity. O
She O
has O
noted O
that O
perhaps O
over O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
or O
so O
that O
a O
callus O
has O
formed O
under O
the O
plantar O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O
left O
foot. O
She O
denies O
any O
drainage, O
erythema, O
or O
increased O
swelling O
or O
warmth O
in O
the O
foot. O
Her O
orthotics O
were O
made O
in O
September O
and O
seem O
to O
be O
working O
quite O
well O
for O
her. O
She O
admits O
however O
that O
over O
the O
last O
month O
and O
half O
or O
so O
that O
she O
has O
been O
wearing O
boots O
that O
her O
current O
orthotics O
do O
not O
fit O
in. O
Apparently, O
she O
has O
had O
to O
resort O
to O
her O
old O
orthotics, O
which O
did O
not O
take O
her O
Charcot O
deformity O
into O
account. O
Her O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
diabetes O

She O
quit O

ten O
years O
ago O
and O
has O
no O
known O
allergies O
to O
medications. O
Physical O
examination O
is O
centered O
mainly O
around O
her O
left O
foot. O
She O
has O
diminished O

She O

either O

At O
the O
apex O
of O
her O
rocker O
bottom O
deformity O
on O
the O
left O
side O
there O
is O
a O
callus O
that O
I O
d O
brided O
in O
the O
office O
underlying O
which O
is O
a O
grade O

ulcer. O
No O
new O

were O

today. O
Diagnosis: O
Grade O
0 O
ulcer, O
diabetic O
left O
foot. O
Plan: O
She O
has O
not O
reached O
the O
dermis O
on O
her O
left O
foot, O
however, O
should O
she O
continue O
to O
weight-bear O
without O
mechanical O
off-loading O
it O
is O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
before O
this O
develops O
into O
a O
grade O
I O
ulcer. O
It O
is O
unclear O
to O
me O
whether O
the O
culprit O
is O
an O
orthotic O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
remolded O
or O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
has O
been O
wearing O
boots O
with O
an O
inappropriate O
orthotic. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
have O
her O
see O
Samantha O
Albright, O
our O
orthotist O
to O
have O
the O
insoles O
remolded O
with O
Plastizote. O
I O
have O
asked O
Ms. O
Xayarath O
to O
bring O
the O
shoes O
that O
she O
typically O
wears O
as O
well O
as O
the O
boots O
she O
wears. O
We O
will O
follow O
this O
development O
closely O
as O
Ms. O
Xayarath O
is O
perfectly O
aware O
of O
the O
potential O
downsides O
of O
forming O
an O
ulcer. O
She O
knows O
to O
contact O
me O
if O
she O
has O
any O
questions O
or O
concerns O
in O
the O
meantime. O

HPI: O
Kadeem O
Vicente O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
a O
follow-up O
office O
visit. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
me O
approximately O
one O
month O
ago O
as O
a O
new O
patient O
and O
whose O
primary O
medical O
concerns O
a O
history B-CAD
of I-CAD
coronary I-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
for O
which O
he O
suffered O
a O
'silent B-CAD
heart I-CAD
attack' I-CAD
many I-CAD
years I-CAD
ago, I-CAD
a O
history O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
as O
well O
as O
hypertension B-HYPERTENSION
and O
GERD. O
As O
it O
turns O
out, O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
on O
Zantac O
for O
many, O
many O
years, O
the O
beneficial O
effects O
of O
which O
were O
unknown. O
We O
had O
decided O
as O
of O
our O
last O
meeting O
to O
stop O
this O
drug O
and O
find O
out O
if O
he O
became O
symptomatic. O
The O
patient O
reports O
today O
that O
he O
is O
not O
symptomatic, O
and O
thus O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
discontinue O
this O
medicine. O
At O
this O
point, O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
need O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
proton O
pump O
inhibitor, O
such O
as O
Prilosec. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
patient's O
symptoms O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
the O
patient O
said O
that O
he O
only O
has O
taken O
one O
dose O
of O
the O
Hytrin, O
since O
he O
wanted O
to O
use O
up O
all O
his O
Minipress, O
which O
he O
tool O
up O
until O
2 O
nights O
ago. O
Thus O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
assess O
the O
efficacy O
of O
this O
medication. O
It O
is O
noted O
that O
his O
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
152/74, B-HYPERTENSION
which O
is O
better O
than O
it O
was O
the O
last B-HYPERTENSION
time I-HYPERTENSION
he I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
here, I-HYPERTENSION
which I-HYPERTENSION
the I-HYPERTENSION
systolic I-HYPERTENSION
range I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
160-170 B-HYPERTENSION
and I-HYPERTENSION
diastolic I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
80-90. I-HYPERTENSION
The O
patient O
reports O
no O
new O
symptomatology O
other O
than O
occasional O
fatigue, O
from O
which O
he O
will O
have O
to O
rest. O
The O
patient O
has O
no O
symptoms O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure, O
no O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
no O
ankle O
edema, O
no O
JVD O
by O
observation, O
and O
his O
laboratory O
results O
are O
remarkably O
normal, O
given O
his O
medical O

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: O
This O
is O
a O
75 O
year O
old O
man O
with O
multiple O
medical O
problems O
coming O
in O
for O
follow-up. O
1. O
Hypertension O
- O
the O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
Zestril B-MEDICATION
and O
will O
use O
Hytrin O
now, O
both O
for O
his O
hypertension, O
as O
well O
as O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy. O
The O
patient O
does O
speak O
of O
some O
nocturnal O
dribbling, O
and O
he O
said O
he O
also O
has O
urge O
incontinence, O
particularly O
while O
standing. O
The O
patient O
was O
told O
that O
after O
a O
trial O
of O
Hytrin, O
which O
hopefully O
can O
help O
with O
his O
symptoms O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
that O
this O
urge O
incontinency O
will O
also O
be O
helped. O
If O
the O
patient's O
symptoms O
continue O
beyond O
this, O
he O
will O
be O
referred O
to O
Urology O
for O
possible O
TUNA O
procedure. O
2. O
BPH O
- O
please O
see O
above. O
The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
Hytrin O
for O
now. O
3. O
? O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
- O
the O
patient's O
cholesterol O
is O
190 O
with O
a O
slightly O
above O
average O
triglycerides, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
acceptable O
for O
this O
gentleman. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
an O
HDL O
in O
which O
to O
judge O
his O
ratio, O
but O
I O
was O
by O
the O
patient O
before O
that O
it O

Therefore O

I O
will O
get O
a O

months, O
and O
if O
there O

Kadeem O
Vicente O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
follow O
up O
office O
visit. O
The O
patient O
is O
seen O
primarily O
for O
follow O
up O
regarding O
his O
history O
of O
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease I-CAD
(the B-CAD
patient I-CAD
is I-CAD
status I-CAD
post I-CAD
inferior I-CAD
wall I-CAD
MI), I-CAD
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy O
and O
to O
a O
much O
lesser O
extent O
osteoarthritis. O
The O
patient O
is O
also O
followed O
GERD-like O
symptoms. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
latter, O
the O
patient O
notes O
that O
since O
he O
has O
been O
off O
the O
Zantac, O
he O
initially O
saw O
no O
change O
in O
his O
ability O
to O
handle O
foods; O
however, O
he O
now O
notes O
that O
he O
is O
starting O
to O
get O
some O
reflux O
and O
feels O
slightly O
uncomfortable O
with O
this. O
He O
denies O
chest O
pain O
per O
se O
and O
any O
symptoms O
pertinent O
to O
cardiovascular O
disease, O
such O
as O
chest O
heaviness, O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
diaphoresis, O
nausea. O
The O
patient O
knows O
the O
foods O
that O
give O
him O
this O
type O
of O
reaction, O
such O
as O
tomato O
based O
sauces O
and O
tries O
to O
avoid O
them O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
The O
patient O
is O
asking O
me O
about O
Prilosec O
which O
he O
recently O
read O
in O
the O
Journal O
and O
was O
wandering O
whether O
this O
would O
be O
a O
suitable O
alternative O
to O
H2 O
blockers O
(Patient O
had O
been O
on O
H2 O
blockers O
for O
many O
years O
without O
a O
trial O
off O
of O
them, O
which O
a O
reason O
that O
we O
stopped O
his O
H2 O
blocker O
therapy O
recently). O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
patient's O
symptoms O
of O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
the O
patient O
says O
that O
these O
have O
almost O
completely O
resolved O
on O
the O
4 O
mg O
of O
Hytrin O
and O
which O
he O
will O
continue O
taking. O
The O
patient O
does O
remain O
on O
Zestril B-MEDICATION
for O
his O
hypertension O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Hytrin O
and O
the O
blood O
pressure O
gotten O
by O
the O

today B-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
150/80 B-HYPERTENSION
and O
repeated O
by O
me O
20 O

later O
was O

PLAN: O

year O
old O
man O

multiple O
medical O
concerns O

for O
follow O
up. O
1. O
Hypertension. O
The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
Zestril, O
once O
a O
day O
as O
well O
as O
his O
Hytrin, O
which O
he O
uses O
also O
for O
BPH. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
appears O
to O
be O
well O
controlled O
on O
this O
regimen. O
One O
of O
the O
issues O
would O
be O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
patient O
should O
be O
on O
a O
beta-blocker. O
The O
patient O
verbally O
has O
a O
history O
of O
'a O
silent O
heart O
attack' O
and O
there O
is O
evidence B-CAD
of I-CAD
an I-CAD
inferior I-CAD

MI I-CAD
and O
this O
is O
certainly O
an O
option O
we O
will O
consider O
in O
the O
future, O
although O
I O
would O
not O
add O
a O
third O
anti-hypertensive O
regimen O
and O
would O
most O
likely O
replace O
his O
Zestril O
with O
a O
beta-blocker. O

patient O
will O
be O
given O
a O
prescription O
for O

for O
the O
next O
2-3 O
months, O
although O
he O
should O
be O
able O
to O
experience O
relief O
almost O
immediately. O
The O
patient O
does O
have O
a O
known O

hernia, O
which O
may O
also O
contribute O
to O
his O
symptoms O
of O

The O
patient O
will O
stay O
on O
his O
4 O
mg O
of O
Hytrin, O
which O
appears O

working O
quite O
well. O
The O
patient O
notes O
that O
there O
is O
less O
dribbling, O
less O
nocturnal O
urination. O
The O
patient O
does O
take O
Lasix O
20 O
mg O
once O
a O
day O
for O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
and O
did O
not O
have O
any O
difficulty O
with O
urination O
after O

takes O

will O
stay O
on O
his O
Ambien O
10 O
mg O
which O
he O
takes O
on O
a O
q.h.s. O
basis. O
The O
patient O
was O
formerly O
on O
Amitriptyline O
but O
was O
told O
that O
the O
secondary O
side O
effects O

can O

tells O

stay O
on O
this. O
Patient O
has O
enough O
to O
last O
until O
I O
see O
him O
next O
time. O
I O
will O
thus O
see O
the O
patient O
in O
3 O
months O
for O
a O
fasting O
lipid O
(The O
patient's O
lipid O
profile O
thus O
far O
has O
been O
acceptable. O
The O
cholesterol O
is O
190 O

an O
acceptable O

however, O
I O
do O
want O
to O
assess O
the O

before O
making O

He O
is O
having O
a O
little O

thinks O
that O
this O
should O

have O
to O

have O
been O

We O
also O
will O
look O

is O

that O

myocardial B-CAD

We O
want O
to O
recheck O
his O
cholesterol O
today. O
We O
also O
have O
been O
concerned O
that O
he O
has O
been O
a O
little O
depressed O
but O
mostly O
because O
he O
is O
concerned O
about O
his O
wife's O
situation O
with O
breast O
cancer. O
We O
had O
a O
long O
discussion O
about O
this. O
Physical O
Examination: O
On O
physical O
examination, O
his O
weight O
is O
250 O
lbs. O
His O
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
was I-HYPERTENSION
178/80. I-HYPERTENSION
The O
follow-up O
was O
170/80. O
His O
neck O
was O
supple. O
Chest O
was O
clear O
to O
both O
percussion O
and O
auscultation. O
Cardiac O
exam O
was O
regularly O
regular O
with O
no O
murmurs, O
gallops O
or O
rubs. O
Abdomen O
was O
soft O
and O
nontender O
with O
no O
hepatosplenomegaly. O
Extremities O
were O
clear O
of O
cyanosis, O
clubbing O
or O
edema. O
Rectal O
tone O
was O
normal O
and O
guaiac O
negative. O
Laboratory O
Data: O
His O
hematocrit O
was O
39.9. O
Platelets O
were O
within O
normal O
limits. O
White O
count O
is O
8.3. O
Digoxin O

Lytes O
are O
within O

Assessment O
and O
Plan: O
1. O
Status O
post O
TURP. O
He O
appears O
to O
be O
recovering O
well. O
He O
has O
had O
slight O
incontinence, O
but O
I O
suspect O
this O
will O
pass. O
2. O
Thrombocytopenia. O
This O
was O
very O
relative. O
It O
now O
appears O
to O
have O
resolved. O
3. O
Coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease. I-CAD
As O
he O
recovers O
from O
his O
TURP, O
I O
question O
whether O
it O
might O
be O
reasonable O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
reexercise O
him. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
he O
is O
quite O
stable O
on O
an O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
digoxin O
and O
Lasix. O
However, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
he O
would O
benefit O
from O
further O
treatment O
with O
anti-anginals. O
4. O
Hypercholesterolemia. B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
This O
has O
been O
well-controlled O
recently. O
His O
last O
cholesterol O
was O
168 O
in O
August O
of O
2093. O
5. O
Depression. O
He O
continues O
on O

He O
has O
some O
discretion O
about O
his O
wife's O
breast O

and O
he O
appears O
to O
have O
some O
of O
his O
uncertainty O
resolved. O

Dear O
Miles: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Vicente O
in O
Cardiovascular O
Care O
today. O
This O
lovely O
77-year O
old O
man O
has O
had O
past O
medical O
history O
notable O
for O
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease, I-CAD
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy, O
depression, O
insomnia, O
osteoarthritis O
status O
post O
total O
knee O
replacement. O
He O
presents O
today O
because O
of O
a O
recent O
exacerbation O
of O
symptomatic O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
His O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
begins O
with O
his O
presentation O
following O
his O
total O
knee O
replacement O
in O
June O
of O
2091. O
In O
10/91 O
he O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
profound O
weakness O
and O
sat O
down. O
He O
had O
no O
clear O
substernal O
chest O
pressure, O
loss O
of O
consciousness O
or O
edema. O
Workup O
at O
that O
time O
included O
a O
thallium O
test O
which O
did O
not O
clearly O
demonstrate O
ischemia O
and O
an O
echocardiogram O
with O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
50%. O
He O
began O
therapy O
at O
that O
point O
in O
time O
with O
aspirin, B-MEDICATION
niacin, B-MEDICATION
vitamin O
E, O
Lasix, O
Zestril, B-MEDICATION
Zantac, O
Minipress, O
Amitriptyline, O
and O
Digoxin. O
He O
had O
been O
free O
of O
exertional O
neck, O
chest, O
arm O
and O
jaw O
pain, O
paroxysmal O
nocturnal O
dyspnea, O
orthopnea, O
palpitations, O
claudication O
and O
TIA O
until O
this O
past O
spring. O
He O
actually O
had O
done O
very O
well O
with O
risk O
factor O
reduction O
including O
completing O
cardiac O
rehab O
at O
MJH O
and O
following O
a O
stringent O
weight O
reduction O
program O
and O
decreasing O
his O
weight. O
In O
March O
of O
2094 O
he O
began O
noticing O
that O
when O
he O
was O
going O
up O
the O
19 O
steps O
in O
his O
house O
he O
began O
having O
mid-sternal B-CAD
chest I-CAD
discomfort I-CAD
and I-CAD
some I-CAD
dyspnea I-CAD
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stairs. O
He O
stopped O
working O
with O
the O
physiotherapist O
at O
that O
point O
and O
was O
initiated O
on O
nitrate B-MEDICATION
therapy. O
Since O
that O
time O
he O
has O
noted O
that O
he O
has O
had O
significant O
decrease O
in O
symptoms O
and O
over O
the O
past O
week O
has O
actually O
had O
no O
need O
to O
take O
sublingual B-MEDICATION
nitroglycerine B-MEDICATION
and O
has O
been O
taking O
the O
full O
flight O
of O
stairs O
without O
difficulty. O
He O
does O
note O
fatigue O
and O

There O
is O
no O

His O

are O
free O
of O

His O
lungs O
are O
entirely O
clear O
to O

throughout, O
and O
cardiac O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
non-displaced O
PMI, O
S1 O
and O
physiologically-split O

with O
no O
murmur, O
rub O
or O

Abdominal O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
ventral O

There O
is O
no O
organomegaly O
and O
neither O

pulses O
with O

Skin O
exam O
is O
notable O
only O
for O
the O

Electrocardiogram O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
left O

which O
is O
new O
since O
prior O
tracing O
available O
here O
of O
4/03/94. O
MIBI O
was O
notable O
only O
for O
a O
potential O
fixed O
anteroseptal O
defect O
and O
no O
significant O
ischemia O
on O
5/6/94. O
The O
ejection O

on O

57%. O
In O
summary, O
it O
appears O
that O
Mr. O
Vicente O
may O
have O
experienced O
a O
new O
myocardial O
infarction O
resulting O
in O
a O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block O
in O
March O
of O
2094. O
He O
could, O
however, O
also O
have O
developed O
his O
progressive O
conduction O
system O
disease O
and O
have O
the O
fixed O
defect O
on O
his O
MIBI O
attributable O
only O
to O
a O
left O
bundle O
branch O
block. O
I O
will O
be O
reviewing O
the O
primary O
images O
to O
make O
my O
final O
decision. O
In O
either O
regard O
he O
is O
now O
free O
of O
symptoms O
on O
his O
current O
medical O
regimen O
despite O
his O
increased O
weight O
and O
his O
increased O
blood O
pressure. O
I O
certainly O
agree O
with O
further O
assistance O
from O
nutrition O
and O
weight O
loss O
and O
proceeding O
with O
Imdur B-MEDICATION
therapy O
which O
I O
would O
increase O
to O
60 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
I O
also O
would O
consider O
further O
decrease O
of O
his O
LDL O
with O
statin O
therapy O
but O
would O
only O
consider O
this O
after O
assessing O
his O
response O
to O
re-initiation O
his O
nutrition O
program. O
Given O
his O
lack O
of O
symptoms O
at O
the O
present O
time O
with O
his O
usual O
daily O
activity, O
I O
would O
prefer O
to O
proceed O
on O
the O
medical O
therapy O
route. O
I O
think O
that O
he O
could O
be O
reintroduced O
to O
rehab O
at O
MJH O
with O
the O
hopes O
that O
further O
education O
can O
get O
him O
back O
on O
line O
in O
terms O
of O
risk O
factor O
reduction. O
I O
certainly O
look O
forward O
to O
discussing O
this O
case O
further O
with O
you. O
It's O
certainly O
a O
pleasure O
to O
participate O
in O
his O
care. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENTING O
COMPLAINT: O
This O
is O
a O
78-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
had O
a O
stuttering O
course O
of O
chest O
discomfort O
throughout O
the O
night, O
last O
night, O
and O
into O
today. O
He O
finally O
took O
nitroglycerin B-MEDICATION
tablets I-MEDICATION
at O
about O
9 O
or O
10:00 O
a.m. O
and O
this O
abated O
his O
chest O
discomfort. O
The O
patient O
has O
known O
history B-CAD
of I-CAD
coronary B-CAD
artery I-CAD
disease B-CAD
and O
recently O
had O
gone O
back O
on O
his O
coronary O
rehab O
program, O
however, O
yesterday O
after O
a O
workout, O
he O
became O
extremely O
tired, O
more O
tire O
than O
usual. O
He O
thought O
he O
might O
have O
pushed O
it O
a O
bit O
and O
he O
rested O
throughout O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day. O
Then O
last O
night, O
he O
had O
some O
chest O
discomfort, O
which O
he O
initially O
did O
not O
think O
much O
of. O
Then O
was O
then O
associated O
with O
some O
shortness O
of O
breath O
in O
the O
early O
morning O
hours. O
He O
felt O
he O
was O
wheezing. O
This O
resolved O
after O
he O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
around. O
He O
took O
the O
nitroglycerin O
tablets O
this O
morning. O
These O
were O
fresh O
nitroglycerin O
tablets O
he O
had O
just O
obtained O
and O
this, O
in O
fact, O
resolved O
his O
symptoms. O
He O
then O
came O
in O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Echeverria, O
his O
physician, O
in O
clinic O
and O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
for O
evaluation. O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
The O
patient O
is O
presently O
comfortable, O
not O
tachypneic. O
His O
blood B-HYPERTENSION
pressure I-HYPERTENSION
is I-HYPERTENSION
160/80. I-HYPERTENSION
His O
heart O
rate O
is O
in O
the O
50s. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
on O
examination. O
There O
is O
no O
jugular O
venous O
distention O
and O
his O
lungs O
are O
clear O
to O

His O
heart O
examination O
is O
distant, O
with O
no O

Abdomen O
in O

LABORATORY O
EVALUATION: O
His O

branch O
pattern O
with O
no O
change O
in O
configuration O
from O

His O
other O

THERAPY O
RENDERED/COURSE O
IN O
ED: O
The O
case O
was O
discussed O
with O
his O
physician, O
Dr. O
Echeverria. O
We O
both O
agree O
that O
the O
patient O
has O
probably O
had O
a O
progression O
of O
his O
coronary O
syndrome O
with O
possible O
unstable O
plaque, O
given O
his O
episode O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
paroxysmal O
nocturnal O
dyspnea. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
he O
has O
silent O
ischemia, O
which O
is O
not O
evident O
because O
of O
the O
left O
bundle O
branch O
pattern. O
Pending O
the O
other O
evaluation O
and O
studies, O
which O
are O
being O
sent O
at O
this O
time, O
the O
patient O
will O
require O
hospitalization O
for O
further O
medical O
management. O
FINAL O
DIAGNOSIS: O
Acute O
coronary O
insufficiency, O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
DISPOSITION O
(including O
condition O
upon O
discharge): O
The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
in O
stable O
condition. O

There O
is O
a O
hematoma O
at O
the O

about O
1 O

Vuong O
has O
a O
history O
of O
diabetes B-DIABETES

of O
24.9. O
Her O

Urinalysis O
showed O
3+ O
albumin O
in O
September O
2062 O
and O
persisting O
proteinuria O
since O
that O
time. O
Dr. O
Yeomans O
obtained O
an O
ultrasound O
examination O
in O
March, O
which O
showed O
diffusely O
thinned O
renal O
cortices, O
but O
no O
evidence O
of O
obstruction, O
stones, O
or O
masses. O
She O
has O
visited O
an O

She O
does O
not O
know O
whether O
signs O
of O

present, O
but O
she O
has O
had O
no O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
examination O
today, O
she O
looks O
tired O
but O
reasonably O
comfortable. O
She O
speaks O
in O
a O
high-pitched O
somewhat O
hoarse O
voice, O
which O
has O
persisted O
since O
one O
of O
her O
surgical O
procedures. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
in O
the O
right O
arm, O
sitting, O
is O
148/60 B-HYPERTENSION
with O
regular O
pulse O
72. O
Her O
chest O
has O
a O
few O
basal O
crackles O
but O
in O
general O
is O
clear O
and O
air O
moves O
comfortably. O
JVP O
fills O
below O
the O
sternal O
angle O
heart O
shows O
a O
grade O
2 O
systolic O
murmur, O
loudest O
at O
the O
upper O
left O
sternal O
border. O
Abdomen O
is O
soft O
and O
nontender. O
There O
is O
no O
renal O
tenderness. O
Extremities O
have O
no O
edema. O
IMPRESSION: O
Progressive O
renal O
failure O
in O
a O
74-year-old O
woman O
with O
more O
than O
10 O
years' O
history O
of O
diabetes O
as O
well O
has O
hypertension O
and O
hyperlipidemia. O
The O
proteinuria, O
if O
confirmed, O
would O
support O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
diabetic O
nephropathy O
but O
this O
would O
be O
unusual O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
retinopathy. O
It O
would O
be O
useful O
to O
know O
from O
her O
ophthalmologist O
whether O
retinopathy O
is O
present. O
It O
is, O
of O
course, O
also O
possible O
that O
she O
has O
vascular O
disease O
involving O
the O
kidneys. O
Their O
symmetry O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
proteinuria O
would O
argue O
against O
this O
possibility. O
The O
ACE O
inhibitor O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
vascular O
disease O
might O
of O
course O
raise O
her O
serum O
creatinine O
by O
reducing O
renal O
blood O
flow O
somewhat. O
Her O
loss O
of O
appetite O
and O
nausea O
may O
well O
be O
related O
to O
the O
degree O
of O
renal O
failure. O
RECOMMENDATION: O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
she O
see O
Filomena O
Xia, O
RD, O
a O
renal O
dietitian, O
to O
learn O
a O
diet O
appropriate O
for O
renal O
failure O
as O
well O
as O
for O
her O
diabetes O
and O
hyperlipidemia. O
This O
might O
succeed O
in O
reducing O
some O
of O
her O
nausea. O
It O
think O
it O
would O
be O
worthwhile O
as O
an O
experiment O
to O
reduce O
or O
discontinue B-MEDICATION
her I-MEDICATION
Accupril I-MEDICATION
and O
perhaps O
her O
Lasix O
temporarily O
to O
see O
whether O
serum O
creatinine O
falls O
with O
less O
ACE O
inhibition O
and O
somewhat O
more O
fluid O
volume. O
If, O
of O
course, O
shortness O
of O
breath O
worsens O
or O
edema O
appears, O
then O
returning O
to O
the O
Lasix O
would O
be O
reasonable. O
It O
might O
be O
that O
a O
longer O
acting, O
milder O
diuretic, O
such O
as O
5 O
mg O
of O
metolazone O
might O
help O
to O
control O
edema O
(and O
potassium) O
and O
reduce O
the O
requirement O
for O
Lasix. O
If O
serum O
creatinine O
fell O
appreciably O
with O
less O
ACE O
and O
diuresis, O
it O
would O
reassure O
us O
that O
the O
damage O
was O
not O
all O
structural, O
and O
it O
might O
be O
then O
possible O
to O
return O
to O
these O
medicines O
with O
less O
worry. O
Her O
anemia O
is O
no O
doubt O
related O
to O
lack O
of O
erythropoietin O
and O
would O
likely O
benefit O
from O
instituting O
therapy O
with O
Epogen O
(such O
as O
4000 O
units O
twice O
a O
week) O
or O
Aranesp). O
PLAN: O
We O
will O
send O
a O
urine O
today O
for O
total O
protein O
to O
creatinine O
ratio, O
which O
may O
help O
us O
decide O
whether O
the O
problem O
is O
mainly O
diabetic O
nephropathy. O
If O
so, O
the O
measures O
proposed O
would O
be O
appropriate. O
We O
discussed O
the O
eventual O
probable O
need O
for O
dialysis O
(assuming O
no O
other O
intercurrent O
medical O
catastrophes). O
It O
would O
be O
useful O
for O
her O
to O
visit O
the O
DCGH O
Renal O
Department O
(located O
here O
on O
our O
floor O
at O
592G, O
along O
with O
Ms. O
Xia's O
office) O
to O
learn O
about O
modes O
of O
dialysis. O
We O
discussed O
construction O
of O
a O
forearm O
fistula, O
which O
should O
be O
done O
well O
before O
a O
need O
for O
it O
arises. O
I O
would, O
in O
fact, O
recommend O
that O
she O
proceed O
to O
have O
this O
done O
in O
the O
next O
few O
months. O
This O
could O
be O
arranged O
through O
Dr. O
Xaysana's O
office O
or O
perhaps O
by O
speaking O
with O
Dr. O
Najee O
Yuan. O
I O
will, O
of O
course, O
help O
with O
any O
of O
these O
measures O
as O
necessary. O
Xander O
Xie, O
M.D. O
Wanda O
Urine O
total O
protein/creatinine O
ratio O
is O
only O
0.11 O
(corresponding O
to O
about O
0.1 O
g/day O
or O
proteinuria). O
This O
is O
a O
very O
small O
amount O
for O
diabetic O
nephropathy, O
and O
argues O
in O
favor O
of O
vascular O
disease. O
I O
would O
suggest O
getting O
a O
MRA O
of O
renal O
arteries O
to O
look O
for O
any O
main O
artery O
obstruction. O
If O
present O
it O
would O
account O
for O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
her O
creatinine O
to O
ACE O
or O
changes O

at O

he O
started O

He O
describes O
the O

as O
lack O

strength. O
He O
states O
he O
really O
didn't O
have O
any O

other O
than O
weakness, O
but O
when O
asked O
about O

worsened O
his O

Impression: O
Mr. O
Wood O
is O
a O
58 O
yo O
M O
w/ O
Hx O
of O
colonic O
polyps O
and O
diverticulosis O
who O
presents O
with O
1 O
day O
of O
weakness O
and O
lightheadedness O
secondary O
to O
a O
microcytic O
anemia. O
His O
Hct O
stabilized O
at O
26 O
since O
his O
transfer O
from O
his O
PCP's O
office. O
His O
anemia O
is O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
lower O
GI O
bleeding O
from O
either O
his O
diverticulosis O
or O
from O
his O
polyposis O
given O
his O
guiac O
positive O
stool O
in O
the O
ER. O
He O
is O
currently O
hemodynamically O
stable O
and O
he O
states O
he O
feels O
much O
better O
symptomatically. O
Given O
that O
he O
hasn't O
had O
a O
follow O
up O
colonoscopy O
since O
the O
poorly O
prepped O
one O
in O
March O
of O
this O
year, O
he O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
be O
reevaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Narvaez. O
Other O
possible O
attributing O
causes O
of O
his O
anemia O
could O
be O
hypothyroidism O
given O
his O
somewhat O
delayed O
response, O
but O
his O
DTR O
were O
normal. O
Iron O
studies O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
confirm O
the O
probable O
diagnosis O
of O
chronic O
GI O
bleeding O
resulting O
in O
iron O
deficiency O
anemia. O
He O
will O
not O
be O
transfused O
now O
given O
that O
he O
is O
asymptomatic O
currently O
and O
he O
prefers O
not O
to O
be O
transfused O
unless O
necessary. O
His O
syncope O
could O
also O
have O
been O
exacerbated O
from O
his O
slight O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
as O
seen O
on O
PE O
and O
his O
high O
Cre O
and O
BUN O
indicating O
that O
he O
is O
volume O
depleted. O
He O
will O
be O
adequately O
hydrated O
to O
correct O
his O
hypotension. O
Given O
his B-CAD
chest I-CAD
pain I-CAD
and O
syncope, O
MI O
will O
be O
ruled O
out, O
but O
this O
is O
very O
unlikely O
given O
his O
clinical O
presentation. O
His O
first O
enzymes O
were O
negative O
and O
his O
EKG O
showed O
no O
Q O

Mr O
Albert O
has O
progressive O
renal O
insufficiency, O
he O
does O
currently O
not O
require O
renal O

therapy. O
Contributors O
may O
be O
Cyclosporine O
toxicity O
and O
intermittent O
dehydration. O
However, O
the O
recent O
more O
rapid O
rise O
makes O
biphosphonate O
toxicity O
or O
HCV-associated O
renal O
disease O
a O
worthy O
consideration. O
Bobbie O

has O
uncontrolled O

took O

For O
now, O
I O
suggest O
to O
hold O
further O
infusions O
of O
Parmidronate O
until O
more O
data O
is O
available. O
Bobbie O
will O
have O
a O

in O
2 O
weeks O
(when O
he O
is O
in O
Nappanee O
for O
another O

and O
I O
will O
see O
him O
in O
four O

At O

REVIEW O
OF O
SYSTEMS: O
Her O

such O
that O

that O

dropped O
but O
when O
she O
checks O
it, O
it O
has O
been O
around O
100 O

and O
I O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
it O
is O
a O
normal O
blood O
sugar O
but O
it O
may O
be O
that O
the O
drop O
causes O
her O
to O
have O
symptoms. O

it O
is O
mostly O

of O

the O

I O
have O
advised O
the O

that O

no O

her O

her O

cares O
nothing O

her O
father O

It O

a O

45 O

the O

what O

RE: O
LINDSAY, O

Dear O
Dr. O
Ho: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mrs. O
Lindsay O
today O
in O
follow O
up O
at O
the O
Saint O
Davids O
Pavilion O
Neurology. O
I O
last O
saw O
her O
on O
07/27/2112. O
She O
is O
a O
72-year-old O
woman O
who O
is O
status O
post O
a O
right O
MCA O
distribution O
cortical O
infarct O
in O
April O
of O
2112 O
with O
residual O
left O
hand O
weakness. O
Since O
I O
last O
saw O
her O
Mrs. O
Lindsay O
has O
not O
done O
very O
well. O
She O
has O
had O
multiple O
recent O
falls O
and O
her O
gait O
has O
become O
even O
more O
unsteady. O
She O
tends O
to O
veer O
to O
either O
side O
and O
does O
have O
a O
frequent O
feeling O
of O
lightheadedness. O
She O
has O
hit O
her O
head O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
with O
these O
falls. O
Of O
note O
her O
blood O
pressure O
medication O
has O
been O
essentially O
doubled O
since O
I O
last O
saw O
her. O
She O
is O
now O
taking O
10 O
mg O
of O
Zestril B-MEDICATION
every O
day O
instead O
of O
five O
and O
taking O
Atenolol B-MEDICATION
50 O
mg O
q.d. O
instead O
of O
25 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
She O
does O
have O
intermittent O
weakness O
of O
the O
left O
hand O
which O
is O
likely O
recrudescent O
of O
her O
prior O
stroke O
symptoms O
and O
not O
new O
strokes. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
discoordination, O
vertigo O
or O
diplopia. O
She O
does O
have O
intermittent O
chest O
pains O
as O
well O
which O
she O
loath O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
her O
physician. O
She O
is O
reluctant O
to O
use O
a O
cane O
because O
her O
family O
states O
that O
'her O
husband O
does O
not O
use O
a O
cane O
and O
he O
is O
older, O
why O
should O
she O
have O
to O
use O
a O
cane'. O
She O
has O
been O
switched O
to O
Plavix B-MEDICATION
75 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
from O
aspirin. O
This O
was O
done O
without O
my O
knowledge O
as O
well. O
She O
continues O
to O
have O
difficulty O
'feeling O
my O
feet' O
and O
this O
has O
been O
a O
chronic O
problem O
for O
her O
as O
well. O
On O
examination O
she O
is O
alert. O
She O
is O
a O
garrulous O
and O
tangential O
historian O
and O
needs O
to O
be O
frequently O
refocussed. O
Her O
speech O
is O
fluent O
in O
English. O
English O
is O
her O
second O
language O
and O
she O
is O
less O
fluent O
in O
that O
language. O
Her O
visual O
fields O
are O
full O
to O
confrontation. O
Her O
extraocular O
movements O
are O
full O
with O
no O
nystagmus. O
Her O
face O
is O
symmetric O
other O
than O
a O
mild O
left O
nasolabial O
fold O
flattening. O
She O
has O
a O
mild O
left O
pronator O
drift O
and O
slowed O
finger O
tapping O
on O
the O
left O
side. O
She O
has O
no O
ataxia O
on O
finger-to-nose-to-finger O
testing. O
Her O
gait O
is O
slightly O
wide-based O
and O
unsteady. O
She O
can O
veer O
to O
either O
side O
and O
frequently O
has O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
someone O
next O
to O
her O
for O
stability. O
IMPRESSION: O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
that O
Mrs. O
Lindsay O
has O
had O
a O
new O
embolic O
event, O
however O
I O
am O
quite O
concerned O
about O
her O
continued O
falling O
and O
difficulty O
with O
both O
her O
continued O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
and O
likely O
hypoperfusion. O
This O
appears O
to O
be O
pressure O
dependent O
and O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
we O
back O
off O
on O
her O
antihypertensive O
medications O
at O
this O
time. O
In O
looking O
at O
her O
recent O
CBCs O
she O
has O
also O
been O
consistently O
anemic O
and O
with O
her O
complaints O
of O
chronic O
fatigue O
I O
think O
this O
could O
certainly O
be O
a O
factor. O
Atenolol O
could O
certainly O
be O
a O
factor O
in O
this O
as O
well O
and O
perhaps O
a O
different O
antihypertensive O
medication O
could O
be O
considered O
or O
it O
could O
be O
discontinued O
altogether. O
Furthermore O
with O
her O
recurrent O
chest O
pains O
she O
should O
seek O
an O
opinion O
from O
her O
primary O
care O
physician O
regarding O
this O
and O
I O
have O
counseled O
her O
to O
do O
so. O
I O
will O
see O
Mrs. O
Lindsay O
in O
follow O
up O
in O
6 O
months O
time O
but O
I O
am O
available O
to O
discuss O
her O
care O
at O
any O
time O
in O
the O
interim. O

presents O
with O
two O
days O
of O
unsteady O
gait, O
weakness, O
mild O
dysarthria O
and O
hallucinations. O
She O
has O
a O
baseline O
amount O
of O
increasing O
forgetfulness, O
decreased O
appetite, O
and O
increased O
somnolence O
over O
the O
past O
2 O
years. O
She O
frequently O
forgets O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
has O
taken O
her O
medications. O
She O
rarely O
leaves O
her O
home O
as O
her O
walking O
is O
limited O
by O
joint O
pain O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
She O
moves O
around O
the O
house O
infrequently O
and O
when O
she O
does O
it O
is O
usually O
from O
the O
bed O
to O
the O
couch O
per O
her O
daughter. O
She O
has O
had O
several O
falls O
in O
the O
recent O
years. O
She O
does O
not O
cook O
and O
is O
overall O
much O
less O
active O
than O
her O
husband O
who O
lives O
with O
her. O
At O
her O
baseline, O
her O
family O
is O
concerned O
that O
she O
has O
been O
developing O
Alzheimer's O
Disease. O
Twelve O
days O
ago, O
she O
underwent O
cataract O
surgery O
on O
her O
R O
eye O
and O
was O
in O
her O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
for O
several O
days O
thereafter. O
However, O
two O
days O
ago, O
she O
started O
to O
hallucinate O
mentioning O
she O
was O
seeing O
flies, O
birds O
and O
spots. O
Her O
family O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
difficulty O
forming O
words O
and O
also O
spoke O
incoherently O
at O
times. O
She O
also O
complained O
of O
dizziness, O
had O
an O
increasingly O
unsteady O
gait, O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
both O
expressing O
no O
interest O
in O
food O
and O
saying O
she O
was O
worried O
about O
not O
being O
able O
to O
swallow. O
She O
has O
also O
been O
falling O
asleep O
very O
rapidly O
recently, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
she O
has O
fallen O
asleep O
on O
her O
plate O
at O
the O
breakfast O
table. O
However, O
she O
has O
also O
woken O
up O
frequently O
at O
night, O
often O
talking O
incoherently O
and O
once O
even O
getting O
up O
and O
attempting O
to O
cook O
breakfast O
at O
3am. O
Her O
family O
also O
mentions O
that O
her O
face O
had O
recently O
become O
swollen. O
Her O
family O
reports O
that O
her O
symptoms O
were O
worsened O
after O
she O
took O
her O
Diamox, O
and O
thus O
they O
stopped O
giving O
it O
to O
her. O
She O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
ED O
on O
10/06/15 O
as O
her O
family O
was O
concerned O
that O
she O
had O
another O
CVA. O

In O
the O
ED O
she O
reportedly O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
choking O
while O
eating O
a O
pancake. O
Currently, O

on O
09/25/15 O
presents O
with O
two O
days O
of O
unsteady O
gait, O
weakness, O
mild O
dysarthria O
and O
hallucinations. O
She O
has O
dementia O
at O
baseline O
and O
has O
recently O
had O
the O
addition O
of O
Diamox, O
a O
carbonic O
anhydrase O
inhibitor, O
to O
her O
medications. O
This O
could O
have O
had O
the O
effect O
of O
decreasing O
her O
intravascular O
volume, O
thus O
leading O
to O
a O
prerenal O
state O
and O
her O
increased O
uremia, O
and O
decreased O
renal O
clearance O
of O
her O
renally O
cleared O
medications, O
thus O
leading O
to O
acute O
delirium O
on O
chronic O
dementia. O
Common O
causes O
of O
delirium O
include O
FEN O
disturbances, O
infections, O
drug O
toxicity, O
metabolic O
disorders, O
low O
perfusion O
states, O
withdrawal O
from O
alcohol O
or O
sedatives, O
and O
idiopathic. O
In O
addition, O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
of O
CVA, O
however O
the O
MRI O
and O
CT O
were O
negative O
and O
the O
time O
course O
and O
symptoms O
are O
not O
consistent O
with O
a O
CVA. O
Of O
concern O
though O
is O
that O
she O
has O
somewhat O
atypical O
signs O
of O
delirium O
such O
as O
dysarthria O
and O
ataxia. O
Metabolic O
causes O
of O
delirium O
commonly O
include O
Na, O
Ca, O
Mg, O
B12, O
NH3 O
imbalances. O
Her O
Na, O
Mg O
and O
Ca O
are O
wnl. O
Her O
BUN O
is O
elevated O
at O
77, O
which O
is O
close O
to O
twice O
her O
baseline, O
and O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
a O
fragile O
patient, O
this O
could O
be O
enough O
to O
tip O
her O
over O
to O
delirium. O
Her O
glucose O
was O
215 O
on O
admission, O
which O
is O
elevated, O
but O
only O
mildly O
so O
for O
a O
diabetic O
and O
not O
at O
high O
enough O
levels O
for O
MS O
changes O
to O
occur. O
Infection O
is O
possible O
as O
her O
WBC O
is O
slightly O
elevated O
at O
12.1 O
with O
78% O
poly's. O
However, O
there O
is O
no O
obvious O
source O
of O
infection O
and O
she O
has O
a O
normal O
CXR O
and O
U/A, O
likely O
ruling O
out O
a O
PNA O
and O
UTI O
respectively. O
She O
has O
no O
signs O
of O
infection O
at O
the O
site O
of O
her O
eye O
surgery. O
She O
could O
have O
a O
bacteremia O
secondary O
to O
other O
infection O
or O
due O
to O
her O
procedure, O
but O
without O
a O
fever, O
this O
is O
highly O
unlikely. O
Her O
mental O
status O
change O
could O
be O
drug O
induced, O
as O
she O
is O
on O
multiple O
medications O
with O
the O
recent O
addition O
of O
Prednisolone O
and O
Vigamox O
eye O
drops O
as O
well O
as O
Diamox O
that O
was O
recently O
stopped O
by O
the O
family. O
Eye O
drops O
generally O
do O
not O
get O
particularly O
high O
systemic O
absorption, O
although O
there O
is O
an O
anatomic O
proximity O
to O
the O
CNS. O
However, O
cardiovascular O
drugs, O
antidepressants, O
and O
corticosteroids O
are O
all O
known O
to O
induce O
delirium O
and O
she O
is O
on O
all O
of O
them, O
including O
two O
SSRI's. O
The O
new O
Diamox O
could O
be O
enough O
to O
tip O
her O
over O
as O
it O
is O
a O
diuretic O
and O
by O
itself O
it O
can O
cause O
confusion, O
and O
by O
inducing O
more O
diuresis, O
it O
can O
cause O
a O
prerenal O
state, O
thus O
decreasing O
renal O
clearance O
of O
her O
other O
drugs O
and O
increasing O
their O
levels, O
thus O
leading O
to O
delirium. O
Indeed, O
her O
baseline O
Creatinine O
is O
from O
1.6-1.9 O
and O
was O
2.4 O
on O
admission O
to O
the O
ED O
and O
her O
baseline O
BUN O
is O
from O
20-40 O
while O
it O
was O
82 O
on O
admission O
to O
the O
ED. O
There O
is O
no O
present O
concern O
for O
drug O
toxicity O
and O
her O
tox O
screen O
was O
negative. O
There O
was O
no O
seizure O
activity O
noted O
and O
her O
symptoms O
have O
gone O
on O
too O
long O
to O
be O
a O
post-ictal O
state O
Her O
BP O
on O
admission O
was O
115/51 O
and O
her O
pulse O
was O
62, O
which O
does O
not O
point O
to O
a O
low O
perfusion O
state O
as O
a O
cause. O
She O
had O
a O
recent O
stress O
test O
that O
was O
negative. O
However, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
she O
has O
some O
orthostasis, O
which O
would O
fit O
with O
her O
recent O
history O
of O
falls O
at O
home. O
However, O
this O
would O
not O
cause O
the O
delirium. O
Her O
dementia O
has O
been O
developing O
over O
a O
few O
years O
and O
the O
possible O
etiologies O
include O
Alzheimer's, O
vascular O
dementia, O
pseudodementia, O
thyroid O
abnormalities, O
B12 O
and/or O
Folate O
deficiency, O
tertiary O
syphilis O
and O
chronic O
infarct O
dementia. O
Chronic O
infarct O
dementia O
is O
a O
distinct O
possibility O
with O
MRI O
of O
brain O
showing O
chronic O
infarcts O
in O
the O
right O
posterior O
frontal O
and O
left O
parietal O
regions. O
Her O
stasis, O
DM O
and O
high O
homocysteine O
levels O
(18.8 O
in O
2113) O
are O
risk O
factors O

Today, O
he O

If O
this O
is O
a O

time O
should O
be O
a O

diagnostic O
test O
at O
this O
should O
improve O
after O

further O
from O
his O

At O
his O
next O

us O
next O

we O
will O
recheck O
his O

for O
some O
idea O

whether O
his O

could O
still O
be O
mounting O
an O

response O
to O
drive O
a O

If O
his O
plt O
count O
comes O
down, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
start O
tapering O
his O
hydrea O
at O
that O
time. O
Of O
note, O
in O
the O
near O

we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
help O
determine O
between O

with O

and O
apparent O

HTN O
who O
presented O
with O

in O

emergency, O
subsequently O
found O
to O
have O
nephrotic O
syndrome, O
renal O
insufficiency, O
and O
several O
small O
embolic-appearing O
strokes. O
In O
this O
setting, O
he O
has O
developed O
marked O
thrombocytosis O
to O
1.5 O
million O
and O
had O
subsequent O
provoked O
DVT. O
He O
was O
treated O
with O

then O
hydrea. O
It O
has O
been O
unclear O
if O
this O
is O
still O
a O
reactive O
thrombocytosis O
vs O
essential O
thrombocytosis. O
We O
are O
following O
his O
CBC O
on O
hydrea. O
His O
platelets O
are O
moderately O
elevated O
(757K). O
He O
has O
no O
evidence O
of O
recurrent O
thrombosis. O
His O
current O
hydrea O
dosing O
cannot O
be O
increased O
due O
to O
his O
anemia. O
We O
would O
advise O
starting O
erythropoetin, O
monitoring O
his O
blood O
pressure O
closely. O
At O
his O
current O
platelet O
count, O
his O
risk O
of O
thrombosis O
is O
not O
greatly O
increased, O
especially O
as O
his O
platelets O
are O
dysfunctional O
due O
to O
uremia. O
We O
would O
advise O
continuing O

Given O
that O
this O

a O

to O
wait O
to O
see O
if O
there O
was O
a O

for O
him O
to O
get O

Mr. O
Robison O
comes O
to O
clinic O
today O
for O
f/u O
after O
being O
hospitalized O
for O
central O
pontine O
CVA O
in O
early O
April. O
He O
has O
been O
working O
with O
OT, O
speech O
therapy O
and O
nutrition O
at O
home, O
with O
some O
improvement O
in O
gait O
and O
fine O
motor O
skills. O
He O
still O
feels O
like O
his O
speech O
is O
poor O
and O
his O
right O
hand O
is O
not O
working O
at O
baseline. O
Other O
complaints O
include O
a O
HA O
every O
morning O
which O
is O
global O
and O
tends O
to O
improve O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
with O
tylenol. O
He O
does O
admit O
to O
some O
visual O
changes O
that O
have O
been O
occuring O
for O
about O
one O
year--transient O
decreased O
vision O
in O
right O
eye, O
lasting O
for O
several O
minutes O
to O
hours O
and O
happening O
about O
twice O
per O
week. O
He O
saw O
an O
ophthamologist O
in O
12/02 O
who, O
per O
the O
patient, O
found O
no O
abnormalities. O
He O
also O
states O
that O
he O
has O
had O
nonproductive O
cough O
with O
chest O
congestion O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks. O
No O
fevers, O
chills, O
n/v O
or O
diarrhea. O
Some O
rhinorrhea O
but O
no O

He O
has O
had O
difficulty O
with O
muscle O
cramps O
since O
his O
BMT O
which O
respond O
well O
to O
gatorade. O
The O
nutritionist O
is O
not O
thrilled O
with O
the O
high O
salt O
content O
of O
gatorade. O
We O
discussed O
the O

Re: O
Neil O
Robison O
#371-97-98 O
Dear O
Wilcox, O
I O
saw O
Mr. O
Robison O
today. O
I O
hadn't O
seen O
him O
since O
last O
year. O
I'm O
very O
pleased O
to O
see O
how O
well O
he's O
done. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
double O
vision, O
no O
staggering, O
and O
no O
numbness O
around O
the O
mouth. O
His O
speech O
is O
a O
little O
slurred O
he O
says O
(unchanged). O
He O
walks O
with O
a O
wide-based O
gait, O
but O
is O
otherwise O
steady O
on O
his O
feet. O
There O
is O
no O
tremor. O
His O
arms O
and O
legs O
are O
strong. O
Extraocular O
movements O
are O
full. O
The O
pupils O
are O
equal. O
There O
is O
no O
ptosis. O
His O
speech O
is O
fluent. O
He O
takes O
one O
aspirin B-MEDICATION
a O
day O
as O
well O
Lipitor B-MEDICATION
and O
some O
vitamins O
(the O
other O
medicines O
he O
doesn't O
recall O
but O
I O
think O
you O
are O
in O
the O
know O
about). O
His O
blood O
pressure O
is O
120/80. O
The O
pulse O
is O
around O
76. O
There O
are O
no O
cervical O
bruits. O
From O
my O
perspective O
he O
is O
doing O
well O
on O
the O
aspirin O
and O
we O
should O
sit O
tight. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
him O
again O
in O
a O
year O
and O
at O
that O
time O
we O
should O
have O
our O
Dopplers O
again O
to O
recheck O
the O
flow O
in O
the O
basilar O
artery. O
The O
right O
vertebral O
is O
dominant O
and O
the O
left O
is O
occluded. O
The O
left O
MCA O
stem O
was O
hard O
to O
visualize O
on O
the O
imaging. O
It O
may O
well O
be O
occluded O
with O
collateralization. O
The O
left O
imaging O
was O
in O
2082. O
He O
is O
stable O
at O
this O
time. O
He O
knows O
to O
call O
if O
he O
develops O
any O
symptoms. O
Best O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Diabetes, O
his O
most O
recent O
hemoglobin O
A1c B-DIABETES
was I-DIABETES
6.5 I-DIABETES
and O
this O
does O
not O
need O
to O
be O
done O
again O
until O
July. O
He O
was O
advised O
again O
to O
continue O
to O
follow O
a O
healthy O
diet O
and O
offered O
again O
referral O
to O
a O
nutritionist, O
currently O
declines O
at O
this O
time. O
He O
is O
up-to-date O
with O
his O
Ophthalmology O
exam. O
2. O
BPH. O
We O
will O
increase O
his O
Flomax O
to O
0.8 O
mg O
to O
see O
if O
we O
can O
further O
improve O
his O
symptoms. O
Fortunately O
they O
are O
responding O
quite O
well O
to O
this. O
3. O
Hypertension. O
This O
is O
not O
adequate O
control O
with O
his O
current O
regimen, O
however, O
we O
are O
increasing O
his O
Flomax O
today O
so O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
how O
he O
does O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
blood O
pressure O
when O
I O
see O
him O
back O
in O
a O
month. O
If O
his O
blood O
pressure O
is O
still O
elevated, O
we O
will O
then O
modify O
his O
antihypertensive O
regimen O
to O
improve O
this. O
4. O
COPD. O
Currently, O
he O
is O
doing O
well O
with O
his O
current O
regimen. O
He O
has O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
flare O
at O
this O
time O
and O
he O
is O
advised O
to O
continue O
getting O
as O
much O
exercise O
as O
possible. O
5. O
Elevated O
cholesterol. O
His O
LDL O
goal O
should O
be O
less O
than O
100 O
if O
not O
less O
than O
70 O
given O
his O
multiple O
medical O
issues. O
If O
his O
LDL O
is O
greater O
than O
70 O
on O
this O
most O
recent O
check O
we O
may O
try O
him O
on O
a O
small O
dose O
of O
simvastatin O
to O
see O
if O
we O
can O
get O
him O
under O
goal O
without O
an O
elevation O
in O
his O
liver O
function O
tests. O
6. O
Abnormal O
liver O
function O
tests. O
These O
are O
a O
combination O
of O
his O
hepatitis O
C O
and O
the O
fatty O
liver. O
It O
is O
reasonable O
to O
have O
him O
seen O
in O
Hepatology O
to O
see O
if O
he O
would O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
treatment O
of O
the O
hepatitis O
C. O
For O
now, O
we O
will O
work O
on O
his O
diabetes, O
weight O
loss O
and O
management O
of O
his O
cholesterol O
and O
we O
will O
refer O
him O
to O
Hepatology. O
Follow O
up O
with O
me O
is O
in O
one O
month. O

She O
has O
rales O
halfway O
up O
bilaterally O
with O
inspiratory O
and O

up O
to O
the O
knees. O
Rectal O
exam O
reveals O
trace O
heme-positive O

that O
is O
brown. O
On O
route, O
the O
patient O
received O
multiple O
doses O
of O
sublingual B-MEDICATION
nitroglycerin B-MEDICATION
as O
well O
as O
IV O
Lasix. O
She O
is O
known O
to O
make O
urine, O
a O
Foley O
catheter O
was O
placed O
immediately. O
IV O
access O
was O
established, O
and O
the O
patient O
received O
large O
doses O
of O
diuretics. O
Was O
immediately O
started O
on O
IV O
nitroglycerin O
and O
a O
BiPAP. O
On O
BiPAP, O
the O
patient's O
oxygenation O
was O
100%. O
LABORATORY O
DATA: O
Labs O
were O
obtained, O
which O
showed O
a O
hematocrit O
of O
36, O
and O
BUN O
and O
creatinine O
of O
15 O
and O
5.1. O
BNP O
was O

Cardiac O
enzymes: O
CK O
was O
334, O
CK-MB O
4.9, O
and O
troponin O
was O
less O

obtained O
within O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
her O
symptoms O
starting, O
magnesium O
was O
low O
at O
1.6. O
Urinalysis O
was O

negative. O
EKG O
was O
sinus O

changes O
concerning O
for O
rate-related O
ischemia. O
There O
were O
no O

Chest O
x-ray O
showed O
bilateral O
CHF. O
The O
Nephrology O
fellow O
covering O
hemodialysis O
was O
notified O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
need O
immediate O
hemodialysis O
and O
this O
was O
scheduled O
for O
6:00 O
a.m. O
DIAGNOSIS: O
End-stage O
renal O
disease, O
hemodialysis O
dependent, O
and O
CHF. O
ASSESSMENT: O
Given O
the O
patient's O
constellation O
of O
symptoms, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
she O
had O
an O
ischemic O
event O
that O
caused O
flash O
pulmonary O
edema O
and O
subsequent O
symptomatology. O
Given O
the O
current O
regimen, O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department, O
the O
patient O
gradually O
improved. O
The O
respiratory O
rate O
was O
noted O
at O
23. O
Her O
heart O
rate O
came O
down O
to O
113 O
and O
blood O
pressure O
was O
well O
controlled O
on O
the O
IV O

noted O
finally O
at O
140/77. B-HYPERTENSION
The O
patient O

IMPRESSION: O
The O
patient O
has O
numerous O
risk O
factors O
for O
stroke O
with O
HTN, O
DM2, B-DIABETES
and O
HLP. O
His O
exam O
is O
consistent O
with O
lateral O
medullary O
pyramid O
lesion O
with O
involvement O
of O
spinalcortical O
tract O
prior O
to O
decussation O
explaining O
ipsilateral O
weakness O
and O
also O
involvement O
of O
the O
spinalthalamic O
tract O
explaining O
contralateral O
deficit O
in O
pain O
sensation. O
His O
vessel O
imaging O
is O
notable O
and O
concerning O
for O
diffuse O
atherosclerotic O
disease, O
specifically O
in O
posterior O
circulation O
in O
distribution O
of O
acute O
stroke. O
The O
patient O
was O
reportedly O
taking O
aspirin, O
though O
reports O
are O
mixed O
and O
this O
needs O
clarification. O
Vessel O
imaging O
did O
not O
implicate O
that O
the O
patient O
suffered O
from O
acute O
vertebro-basilar O
thrombo-embolism, O
but O
that O
his O
posterior O
circulation O
disease O
is O
a O
chronic O
issue O
and O
the O
stroke O
was O
more O
likely O
due O
to O
distal O
vessel O
thrombosis. O
Anticoagulation O
can O
be O
considered O
in O
acute O
setting O
of O
small O
sized O
posterior O
circulation O
stroke O
with O
vertebro-basilar O
disease, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
by O
the O
time O
the O
patient O
became O
known O
to O
neurology O
service O
and O
by O
the O
time O
it O
was O
known O
he O
had O
a O
stroke O
it O
was O
some O
24hrs O
after O
initial O
symptoms, O
and O
in O
this O
interval O
he O
did O
not O
show O
any O
signs O
or O
symptoms O
of O
stroke O
progression O
making O
unstable O
plaque O
unlikely. O
Given O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
WASID O
study O
that O
anticoagulation O
did O
not O
significantly O
improve O
recurrent O
stroke O
prevention O
benefits O
over O
aspirin O
for O
symptomatic O
vertebro-basilar O
disease O
(because O
warfarin O
benefits O
were O
offset O
by O
higher O
hemorrhage O
rates), O
the O
decision O
to O
place O
this O
patient O
on O
aspirin O
is O
supported. O
The O
long O
term O
management O
of O
this O
patient O
requires O
aggressive O
control O
of O
atherosclerotic O
risk O
factors O
such O
as O
HTN, O
DM2, O
and O
HLP. O
The O
patient O
is O
significantly O
at O
risk O
of O
major O
ischemic O
stroke O
due O
to O
occluded O
right O
carotid O
artery O
and O
diffuse O
posterior O
circulation O
disease, O
and O
it O
is O
conceivable O
that O
if O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
persistent O
symptoms O
in O
the O
future O
that O
a O
revascularization O
procedure O
may O
be O
necessary. O

She O
has O
been O
having O
symptoms O

which O
are O
difficult O
to O
understand O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
I O
cannot O
get O
a O
clear O
history O
of O
her O
symptoms. O
At O
times O
she O
reports O
that O
she O
feels O
dizzy O
as O
if O
she O
might O
fall O
over O
to O
her O
right O

There O
is O
no O

She O
has O
not O
actually O
had O

There O
is O
no O
positional O
component O
to O
her O
symptoms. O
I O
had O
scheduled O
her O
for O
an O
MRA/MRI O
to O
evaluate O
those O
symptoms. O
The O

does O
show O
some O
small O

changes O
in O
the O
coronal O

She O
had O

She O
reports O
that O

be O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Gabriel O
Wilson O
is O
a O
72-year-old O
Croatian O
female, O
referred O
by O
Dr. O
Fraser O
for O
evaluation O
of O
complaints O
of O
dizziness. O
Her O
daughter, O
who O
is O
a O
Library O
Manager O
here, O
accompanies O
her O
mother O
today. O
Apparently, O
for O
many O
years, O
perhaps O
as O
many O
as O
five, O
her O
mother O
has O
complained O
of O
'feeling O
pulled' O
when O
she O
walks. O
This O
never O
occurs O
when O
lying O
down O
or O
sitting. O
It O
is O
only O
when O
she O
is O
walking O
that O
she O
feels O
she O
is O
being O
pulled, O
either O
to O
the O
right, O
left, O
forward O
or O
backward. O
At O
times, O
she O
does O
visibly O
veer O
when O
she O
walks. O
She O
has O
had O
one O
fall O
a O
number O
of O
months O
ago O
when O
she O
broke O
her O
wrist. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
any O
subsequent O
falls. O
There O
is O
no O
associated O
true O
spinning O
vertigo, O
no O
associated O
visual O
change, O
numbness, O
weakness, O
change O
in O
gait, O
change O
in O
speech O
and O
no O
headache. O
She O
actually O
feels O
that O
over O
the O
past O
few O
weeks, O
it O
has O
been O
a O
little O
better, O
though O
prior O
to O
that, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
more O
severe. O

IMPRESSION: O
72-year-old O
female O
with O
diabetes, O
chronic O
hepatitis O
C O
and O
hypertension, O
complaining O
of O
basically O
veering O
of O
her O
gait O
and O
feeling O
unsteady. O
She O
is O
symptomatic O
only O
when O
she O
walks. O
Her O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
mild O
vibratory O
loss O
in O
the O
toes, O
likely O
due O
to O
diabetic O
neuropathy, O
bilateral O
lower-extremity O
dysmetria O
and O
the O
wide-based, O
at O
times O
veering O
gait. O
It O
appears O
that O
her O
gait O
difficulties O
with O
veering O
are O
multifactorial, O
due O
to O
history O
of O
multiple O
lacunar O
infarcts O
and O
peripheral O
neuropathy. O
It O
does O
not O
appear O
that O
these O
episodes O
are O
due O
to O
transient O
ischemic O
attacks, O
given O
that O
she O
veered O
in O
the O
office O
while O
walking O
and O
stated O
that O
this O
was O
the O
symptom O
she O
is O
concerned O
about. O
However, O
given O
her O
mid-segment O
basilar O
stenosis O
seen O
on O
MRI, O
she O
certainly O
could O
become O
symptomatic O
from O
this O
down O
the O
road, O
particularly O
if O
she O
became O
hypotensive. O
As O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
tolerate O
Aggrenox, O
will O
try O
adding O
Persantine O
at O
a O
lower O
dose O
at O
25 O
mg O
b.i.d., O
along O
with O
an O
aspirin B-MEDICATION
per O
day, O
to O
see O
if O
she O
can O
tolerate O
gradually O
increased O
doses O
of O
Persantine. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
in O
follow O
up O
in O
two O
months O
to O
see O
how O
she O
is O
doing. O
May O
also O
consider O
checking O
CBC, O
given O
her O
symptoms O
of O
fatigue O
and O
other O
bloodwork O
should O
these O
symptoms O
persist. O

related O
a O
history O
of O
exertional B-CAD
chest I-CAD
pain I-CAD
and O
was O
sent O
up O
here O
for O

was O
to O
keep O
her O

in O
the O
140-160 O
range O
since O
they O
may O
be O
due O

Patient O
is O
a O
76-year-old O
Croatian O
woman O
who O
came O
in O
today. O
Her O
daughter O
Gibbs O
was O
translating. O
She O
is O
a O
very O
complicated O
76-year-old O
Croatian O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
vertebral O
basilar O

chronic O
hepatitis O
B O
and O
other O
medical O
problems. O
She O
is O
status O
post O
a O
right O
Bell's O
palsy O
in O
the O
past. O
Recently O
she O
has O
been O
sometimes O
living O
at O
her O
daughter's O
house O
and O
other O
times O
at O
her O
niece's O
house. O
They O
are O
trying O
to O
provide O
more O
support O
in O
terms O
of O
regulating O
that O
she O
takes O
her O
medication. O
When O
she O
stays O
at O
her O
daughter's O
Gibbs's O
house O
her O
daughter O
does O
check O
her O
sugars O
though O
her O
niece O
does O
not. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
has O
been O
very O
labile O
recently O
and O
we O
recently O
added O
hydrochlorothiazide B-MEDICATION
and O
nifedipine B-MEDICATION
extended O
release O
30 O
mg O
every O
day O
to O
her O
regimen O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
regular O
Cozaar B-MEDICATION
and O
Toprol. B-MEDICATION
Her O
daughter O
also O
has O
increased O
her O
insulin/70/30 B-MEDICATION
to O
48 O
units O
in O
the O
morning. O
She O
thinks O
that O
sometimes O
in O
the O
afternoon O
or O
late O
afternoon O
she O
may O
have O
some O
low O
sugars. O
She O
reports O
that O
her O
mother O
feels O
dizzy O
and O
has O
difficulty O
moving O
her O
left O
leg O
if O
her O
sugar O
gets O
low. O
She O
feels O
better O
if O
she O
is O
given O
orange O
juice O
or O
something O
to O
eat. O
She O
has O
had O
similar O
symptoms O
to O
that O
with O
low O
sugars O
in O
the O
past O
however O
when O
the O
daughter O
checks O
her O
sugars O
they O
are O
all O
in O
the O
174 O
to O
225 O
range. O
She O
has O
occasional O
sugars O
before O
bedtime O
that O
are O
337 O
and O
249. O
The O
lowest O
sugar O
she O
had O
was O
88 O
before O
dinner. O
The O
patient O
reports O
that O
she O
feels O
dizzy O
at O
times. O
She O
is O
a O
very O
difficult O
historian O
even O
with O
her O
daughter O
translating O
or O
with O
the O
other O
interpreters O
translating. O
She O
has O
not O
been O
having O
any O
chest O
pain O
or O
palpitations. O
Her O
dizziness O
is O
not O
related O
to O
standing O
up O
or O
lying O
down. O
No O
syncope, O
slurred O
speech, O
spinning O
dizziness, O
diplopia, O
or O
focal O
arm O
or O
leg O
weakness O
or O
numbness. O
Of O
note O
the O
chest O
pain O
she O
had O
complained O
about O
on O
the O
last O
visit O
when O
her O
daughter O
had O
noted O
she O
was O
cleaning O
has O
resolved. O
Her O
cardiac O
stress O
test O
from O
June O
2094 O
showed O
an O
exercise O
capacity O
of O
4 O
METS, O
EKG O
nondiagnostic O
due O
to O
submaximal O
heart O
rate O
response. O
No O
evidence O
for O
ischemia O
on O
the O
perfusion O
images. O
From O
March O
2095 O
her O
vascular O
lab O
studies O
showed O
normal O
distal O
vertebral O
arteries O
and O
basilar O
arteries O
throughout O
its O
length. O
She O
also O
had O
carotid O
studies O
March O
2095 O
that O
showed O
minimal O
disease O
of O
the O
right O
and O
left O
carotid. O
Her O
prior O
MRI O
from O
07/95 O
showed O
chronic O
lacunar O
infarcts O
but O
no O
acute O
hemorrhage O
or O
infarct. O
The O
patient O
has O
had O
chronic O
slow O
speech O
and O
there O
is O
question O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
has O
dementia. O
Her O
daughter O
is O
giving O
her O
the O
Aricept O
though O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
if O
this O
is O
benefiting O
her O
or O
not. O
Sometimes O
her O
daughter O
thinks O
that O
she O
is O
actually O
just O
being O
stubborn O
or O
uncooperative O
rather O
than O
having O
difficulties O
with O
her O
memory O
though O
other O
times O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
she O
she O
does O
have O
some O
dementia. O
She O
also O
has O
been O
followed O
in O
Glancy O
Memorial O
Hospital. O
On O

Her O

attributes O
some O
of O
her O
lightheadedness O
to O
hypoglycemia O
but O
the O
documented O
sugars O
are O
not O
at O

Ideally O
we O
would O
correlate O
her O
symptoms O
with O
a O
fingerstick O

Lightheadedness O
and O
dizziness. O
We O
are O
going O
to O
check O
a O

and O
then O
repeat O
an O
MRI/MRA O
of O
her O
head O
and O
neck. O
She O
should O
follow O
up O
in O
neurology O
and O
also O
with O
her O
counselor. O
She O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
the O
MRI/MRA. O

by O
his O
MEDIQUIK O
psychiatrist, O
Dr. O
Prince O
from O
her O
clinic O
today O
for O
active O
suicidal O

Dr. O
Prince O
had O
arranged O
involuntary O
hospitalization O
for O
this O
pt O
with O
campus O
security O
and O
EMS, O
prior O
to O
his O
arrival O
for O
the O
appointment. O
However, O
per O
Mr. O
Vaughn, O
he O
arrived O
to O
the O
appointment O
only O
with O
the O
expectation O
of O
discussing O
his O
depression O
and O
refilling O
his O
Celexa, O
which O
he O
has O
been O
unable O
to O
take O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
weeks, O
due O
to O
an O
expired O
prescription. O
Dr. O
Prince O
documents O
a O
discussion O
in O
which O
the O
pt O
was O
tearful O
and O
emotional, O
while O
describing O
active O
suicidal O
ideation O
with O
a O
plan O
to O
overdose O
on O
oxycodone. O
He O
reportedly O
had O
several O
episodes O
this O
past O
week, O
where O
he O
had O
more O
than O
a O
hundred O
oxycodone O
pills O
in O
his O
hand, O
but O
did O
not O
follow O
through O
on O
his O
plans. O
Given O
concern O
for O
imminent O
danger, O
a O
Section O

was O
completed, O
and O
pt O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
MANAMANA O
ED. O
The O
pt O
does O
admit O
to O
phobias O
of O
the O
hospital, O
and O
strong O
desire O
to O
avoid O
admission. O
However, O
he O
states O
that O
his O
last O
suicidal O
ideation O
was O
approximately O
2 O
weeks O
ago, O
and O
that O
he O
changed O
his O
mind, O
once O
he O
realized O
his O
mother&#8217;s O
soon-to-be O
ex-husband, O
who O
has O
been O
threatening O
her, O
will O
be O
released O
from O
prison O
soon. O
Moreover, O
he O
states O
that O
he O
has O
been O
taking O
all O
his O
medications, O
checking O
his O

at O

with O

months. O
She O
notes O
that O
an O

explanation. O
Her O
endocrinologist O
had O
her O
stop B-MEDICATION
her I-MEDICATION
Actos I-MEDICATION
which O
resulted O
in O

however, O
the O
patient O
has O
developed O
leg O
swelling O
again. O
She O
denies O
paroxysmal O
nocturnal O
dyspnea. O
She O
does O
note O
some O
exertional O
shortness O
of O

which O
she O
attributes O
to O
her O
weight. O
She O
has O
no O
history O
of O

She O
has O
not O
noted O

She O
does O
note O
a O
history O
of O
sleep O

The O
patient O
notes O
that O
she O
had O
a O
sleep O
study O
at O
some O
point O
in O
the O
past O
two O
or O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Edema. O
The O
patient's O
edema O
is O
likely O
multifactorial. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
evidence O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
today. O
I O
reviewed O
her O
dietary O
sodium O
intake, O
which O
sounds O
to O
be O
acceptable. O
She O
may O
benefit O
from O
additional O
nutrition O
counseling O
regarding O
this O
issue. O
Her O
leg O
swelling O
may O
also O
relate O
to O
her O
Norvasc O
use. O
I O
did O
not O
see O
her O
urine O
microalbumin O
testing O
and O
laboratory O
studies O
the O
patient O
brings O
with O
her O
today. O
Significant O
proteinuria O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
her O
edema O
as O
well. O
The O
patient O
has O
had O
no O
reactions O
to O
sulfa O
medications O
and O
has O
never O
been O
on O
a O
thiazide O
diuretic O
to O
her O
knowledge. O
I O
recommended O
initially O
that O
she O
stop B-MEDICATION
the I-MEDICATION
Norvasc I-MEDICATION
and O
start O
hydrochlorothiazide O
25 O
mg O
q.d. O
I O
discussed O
the O
use O
and O
side O
effects O
of O
this O
medication. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
the O
office O
in O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
to O
review O
her O
progress. O
2. O
Low O
back O
pain. O
I O
recommend O
the O
patient O
continue O
her O
Bextra. O
We O
discussed O
other O
pain O
medications O
including O
narcotics. O
We O
elected O
against O
using O
these O
medications O
today. O
3. O
History O
of O
sleep O
apnea. O
The O
patient O
has O
significant O
fatigue. O
This O
may O
be O
due O
to O
her O
sleep O
apnea. O
In O
addition, O
her O
difficulty O
with O
her O
weight O
as O
well O
as O
fluid O
retention O
may O
relate O
to O
her O
poorly O
controlled O
sleep O
apnea. O
I O
discussed O
this O
with O
her O
today. O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
she O
return O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
sleep O
study. O
She O
did O
not O
have O
good O
luck O
with O
a O
sleep O
mask O
but O
might O
do O
better O
with O
a O
nasal O
mask. O
She O
will O
think O
about O
this O
and O
we O
will O
review O
it O
again O
on O
her O
follow O
up O
visit. O

She B-SMOKER
was O
last O
in O
the O
clinic O
on O
October O
24, O
2063. O
She O
comes O
in O
today O
with O
her O
husband O
and O
daughter. O
(Her O
daughter O
is O
her O
legal O
healthcare O
proxy.) O
They O
come O
in O
to O
follow O
up O
on O
a O
recent O
hospitalization O
at O
Mid O
Coast O
Hospital. O
In O
January, O
she O
was O
noted O
by O
her O
family O
to O
be O
agitated O
and O
confused. O
She O
was O
missing O
her O
medication O
or O
taking O
too O
much O
medication O
at O
times, O
including O
her O
insulin. B-MEDICATION
She O
also O
became O
paranoid O
when O
efforts O
were O
made O
to O
intervene O
to O
assist O
her. O
Her O
family O
notes O
that O
this O
seemed O
to O
begin O
after O
her O
gabapentin O
dose O
was O
increased O
to O
600 O
mg O
bid. O
She O
was O
also O
taking O
some O
other O
drugs O
at O
the O
time O
that O
affect O
the O
central O
nervous O
system, O
including O
trazodone, O
benzodiazepines, O
and O
narcotics O
for O
back O
pain. O
She O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
geriatric O
psychiatry O
unit O
at O
Mid O
Coast O
in O
January O
2065. O
She O
stayed O
there O
for O
almost O
a O
week. O
According O
to O
the O
family, O
some O
medications O
were O
discontinued O
and O
donepazil O
was O
started. O
Also, O
they O
think O
she O
had O
a O
brain O
MRI. O
She O
improved O
and O
was O
ultimately O
discharged. O
She O
has O
done O
much O
better O
since O
discharge. O
She O
went O
with O
family O
to O
Michigan. O
They O
report O
that O
there O
she O
was O
much O
better, O
playing O
water O
volleyball O
last O
week. O
Her O
husband O
is O
now O
supervising O
her O
medications. O
He O
still O
notices O
some O
memory O
loss, O
but O
this O
has O
improved O
since O
her O
discharge. O
She O
has O
had O
frequent O
headaches. O
She O
has O
noted O
no O
urinary O
incontinence O
and O
no O
worsening O
of O
her O
gait. O
According O
to O
available O
notes, O

On O
examination O
today O
pulse O
is O
60 O
and O
regular. O
BP O
is O
104/60. O
She O
is O
alert O
and O
oriented O
to O
time, O
except O
the O
precise O
date. O
She O
is O
aware O
that O
yesterday O
was O
Tuesday. O
She O
is O
oriented O
to O
place. O
Her O
mental O
and O
motor O
responses O
are O
slightly O
slow. O
She O
displays O
an O
appropriate O
sense O
of O
humor. O
She O
attends O
well. O
She O
recites O
the O
months O
of O
the O
year O
promptly O
forwards O
and O
backwards. O
She O
registers O
4 O
of O
4 O
words. O
She O
recalls O
3/4 O
at O
one O
minutes O
and O
the O
4th O
with O
a O
semantic O
clue O
with O
a O
slight O
error O
'14 O
Massachusetts O
Drive' O
rather O
than O
24 O
Massachusetts O
Drive. O
At O
5 O
minutes, O
she O
recalls O
all O
4 O
with O
only O
the O
error, O
'14 O
Massachusetts O
Drive' O
but O
with O
no O
need O
for O
a O
clue. O
At O
10 O
minutes, O
she O
recalls O
2/4 O
without O
any O
clue, O
the O
3rd O
with O
a O
semantic O
hint, O
and O
the O
4th O
with O
a O
semantic O
hint O
again O
as O
'14 O
Massachusetts O
Drive.' O
She O
readily O
adds O
a O
simple O
sum O
in O
her O
head. O
She O
follows O
multiple O
step O
commands. O
She O
copies O
interlocking O
pentagons O
and O
a O
3D O
cube O
well O
with O
only O
slight O
3D O
perspective O
distortion. O
She O
constructs O
a O
clock O
well O
with O
good O
planning O
and O
no O
neglect. O
Visual O
fields O
are O
full. O
Pupils O
are O
2.5 O
mm O
and O
reactive. O
Fundi O
are O
not O
well O
visualized. O
There O
rest O
of O
the O
cranial O
nerves O
are O
intact. O
Muscle O
bulk, O
tone, O
and O
power O
are O
normal. O
There O
are O
not O
extrapyramidal O
features, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
paratonia. O
Reflexes O
are O
damp O
in O
the O
arms O
and O
absent O
at O
the O
ankles O
(UE O
1/4, O
knees O
2/4, O

and O
symmetric. O
Plantar O
responses O
are O
flexor. O
Romberg O
is O
negative. O
She O
walks O
without O
hesitation O
in O
gait O
initiation. O
Her O
stride O
is O
reasonably O
good, O
Her O
base O
is O
only O
slightly O
widened. O
She O
tandem O
walks O
with O
moderate O
unsteadiness. O
The O
examination O
has O
not O
changed O
much O
from O
her O
visit O
in O
October O
2063. O
She O
has O
some O
problems O
with O
memory O
by O
examination, O
but O
this O
seems O
to O
have O
improved O
greatly O
since O
her O
hospitalization. O
Her O
confusion O
and O
reported O
paranoia O
seem O
to O
have O
gone O
away. O
Except O
or O
mild O
psychomotor O
slowing, O
she O
does O
not O
have O
features O
to O
suggest O
NPH O
as O
the O
cause, O
such O
as O
urinary O
incontinence O
or O
magnetic O
gait. O
I O
suspect O
that O
her O
recent O
deterioration O
was O
due O
to O
adverse O
reaction O
to O
psychoactive O
medication O
that O
has O
now O
been O
discontinued O
of O
limited. O
We O
will O
make O
no O
change O
in O
medication O
today. O
We O
will O
request O
the O
recent O
MRI O
from O
Mid O

She O
will O
return O
in O
several O

after O
we O
have O
gotten O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
The O
patient O
is O
in O
no O
distress. O
Her O
initial O
blood O
pressure, O
as O
she O
walked O
down O
the O
hall, O
was O
154/71. B-HYPERTENSION
Repeating O
this O
after O
sitting O
was O
126/68. O
Lungs: O
Clear. O
Cardiac: O
Regular. O
Extremities: O
Trace O
edema. O
ASSESSMENT: O
Uncontrolled O
adult O
onset O
diabetes. O
Care O
for O
this O
will O
be O
challenging O
due O
to O
the O
patient's O
cognitive O
problems. O
She O
does O
use O
Valley O
Hospital O
Web O
Services. O
We O
discussed O
to O
start O
frequent O
communication O
via O
Web O
Services O
of O
test O
results O
will O
be O
helpful O
for O
me O
in O
helping O
her O
adjust O
insulin. O
We O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
of O
changing O
from O
NPH O
to O
Lantus B-MEDICATION
insulin, O
but O
elected O
to O
continue O
her O
NPH O
for O
now. O
We O
discussed O
that O
her O
use O
of O
the O
ultra-fast O
acting O
insulin O
does O
not O
quite O
make O
sense. O
She O
is O
taking O
an O
injection O
in O
the O
evening, O
long O
after O
her O
meal. O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
describe O
her O
meals O
and O
she O
has O
carbohydrates O
essentially O
with O
every O
meal. O
I O
think O
initially O
she O
can O
easily O
tolerate O
10 O
units O
of O
Humalog O
with O
each O
meal. O
She O
notes O
that O
she O
prefers O
to O
inject O
the O
insulin O
after O
she O
eats, O
which O
is O
acceptable O
as O
long O
she O
does O
it O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
the O
meal. O
She O
currently O
is O
using O
an O
average O
of O
15 O
units, O
so O
this O
will O
increase O
her O
total O
daily O
insulin O
use O
by O
just O
15 O
units. O
I O
asked O
her O
to O
check O
3 O
fingersticks O
a O
day O
for O
me O
and O
to O
e-mail O
them O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
start. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fasting O
fingerstick. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
before O
her O
evening O
meal, O
which O
is O
her O
largest O
meal O
of O
the O
day. O
She O
will O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
2 O
hours O
after O
her O
evening O
meal. O
She O
does O
not O
need O
to O
check O
a O
fingerstick O
right O
before O
bed. O
She O
will O
stop O
using O
Humalog O
right O
before O
bed O
and O
only O
use O
the O
NPH O
at O
that O
time. O
We O
discussed O
the O
importance O
of O
cholesterol O
treatment. O
Her B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
last B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
LDL I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
was I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
over I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
100. I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
I O
would O
like O
to O
revisit O
the O
idea O
of O
using O
a O
statin. O
I O
will O
repeat O
her O
CK O
level O
to O
see O
if O
this O
remains O
elevated. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
on O
recheck O
is O
acceptable. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
the O
office O
in O
2 O
months O
rather O
than O
what O
is O
booked O
now. O
Most O
of O
our O
visit O
today O
took O
place O
together O
with O
her O
husband. O
We O
spent O
a O
total O
of O
25 O
minutes O
with O
more O
than O
half O
the O
time O
spent O
in O
counseling. O

He O
saw O
colored O

floating O
in O
his O
visual O
field. O
He O
has O
been O
noting O
some O
decreased O

and O
visual O
acuity. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
he O
has O
been O
getting O
throbbing O
unilateral O
headaches, O
which O
he O
believes O
were O
migraines. O
He O
saw O
an O
ophthalmologist O
at O
Mediquik O
who O
told O
him O
that O
his O
eye O
exam O
was O
within O
normal O
limits. O
He O
was O
then O
referred O
to O
Dr. O
Gill O
for O
neurologic O
evaluation. O
Dr. O
Gill O
did O
not O
note O
any O
significant O
neurologic O
deficits. O
However, O
during O
his O

Of O
note, O
the O

I O
saw O
the O

I O
had O
sent O
him O
a O
letter O
stating O
that O
his O

was O
slightly O

asking O
him O
to O

He O
never O

Diabetes. B-DIABETES
The O
patient O
was O
advised O
that O
his O
laboratory O
testing O
and O
symptoms O
are O
all O
consistent O
with O
adult-onset B-DIABETES

Given O
the O
severity O
of O
his O

I O
have O
elected O
to O
start O
him O
on O

He O
is O
asked O
to O
return O

for O
follow O
up O
of O
his O

He O
was O
advised O
that O
his O
visual O
changes O
are O
likely O
due O
to O

due O
to O
the O

I O
assume O
that O
this O
will O
resolve O
as O

Mr. O
Jacks O
is O
an O

with O
a O
history O
of O
dementia, O
lung O

CHF O
who O
presents O
with O
progressively O
worsening O
agitation O
at O
home. O
As O
patient O
is O
currently O
very O
somnolent O
this O
history O
is O
based O
on O
phone O
interview O
with O
Ursula O
Jacks O
who O
is O
the O
HCP O
and O
is O
very O
involved O
with O
his O
father's O
care. O
The O
patient O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
dementia O
by O
his O
PCP O
about O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
has O
been O
relatively O
stable O
living O
at O
home O
(on O
2nd O
floor) O
in O
Keystone O
Heights O
with O
his O
wife O
who O
has O
been O
his O
primary O
caretaker; O
their O
two O
sons O
are O
very O
involved O
as O
well. O
Over O
the O
last O
6 O
months O
they O
have O
noticed O
increasing O
confusion, O
agitation, O
and O
labile O
emotions. O
They O
noted O
he O
has O
been O
confused O
about O
location, O
time O
(recalls O
distant O
past O
but O
not O
recent O
past), O
and O
has O
occasionally O
not O
been O
able O
to O
identify O
his O
wife. O
He O
has O
become O
emotionally O
labile O
and O
sometimes O
agitated. O
His O
son O
notes O
that O
he O
recently O
had O
to O
physically O
force O
him O
to O
sit O
down O
and O
take O
his O
medications. O
His O
wife O

About O
1 O
wk O

while O
his O

out O

he O
wandered O
out O
and O
locked O
himself O
out; O
when O

he O
angrily O
accused O
her O
of O
locking O
him O
out. O
Their O
mother O
has O
had O
increasing O
difficulty O
caring O
for O
him O
and O
has O
called O
the O

daily O
for O
the O

called O
his O

and O
he O
was O
started O
on O
lorazepam O
0.5-1mg O

prn O
which O
brought O
mild O
improvement. O
Out O
of O
concern O
for O
his O
father's O
and O
mother's O
safety O
they O
brought O
him O
to O
the O
ED O
for O
evaluation O
and O

which O
their O
PCP O
has O
already O
begun O

are O
intact O
peripherally. O
He O
has O
no O
abdominal O
bruits. O
His O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
is O
14 O
cm. O
He O
has O
no O
cervical O
adenopathy O
or O
thyromegaly. O
His O
liver O
percusses O
at O
approximately O
5 O
cm O
below O
the O
costal O
margin. O
He O
has O
some O
increased O
resonance O
around O
the O
umbilicus. O
Laterally, O
there O
is O
suggestion O
of O
some O
fluid O
in O
the O
distention. O
There O
is O
no O
peripheral O
edema. O
His O
joints O
are O
without O
obvious O
deformities, O
although O
he O
describes O
arthritis O
in O
his O
shoulder, O
neck, O
and O

no O
skin O

several O

ecchymoses. O
His O

unchanged. O
He O
has O

at O

ASSESSMENT: O
1. O
Etiology O
of O
left O
ventricular O
dysfunction O
is O
undetermined. O
We O
do O
not O
know O
information O
of O
recent O
catheterization O
or O
echocardiography. O
The O
degree O
of O
his O
mitral O
disease O
is O
not O
clear. O
He O
clearly O
did O
not O
have O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
on O
one O
studied O
initially. O
However, O
the O
episodicity O
is O
significant. O
2. O
Current O
hemodynamic O
status O
shows O
marked O
volume O
overload O
and O
low O
cardiac O
output, O
and O
is O
cold O
and O
wet O
pattern. O
His O
history O
of O
recent O
diuretic O
use O
suggests O
that O
he O
may O
have O
had O
relatively O
rapid O
onset O
of O
fluid O
after O
his O
last O
diuretic O
change. O
However, O
the O
episode O
while O
playing O
pool O
also O
raises O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
ventricular O
tachyarrhythmia O
undetected. O
It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
this O
is O
related O
to O
angina. O
3. O
Other O
related O
risks. O
He O
is O
on O
Coumadin O
due O
to O
his O
embolic O
shower O
before. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
he O
has O
had O
other O
emboli, O
possibly O
even O
to O
coronary O
arteries O
leading O
to O
recent O
decline O
in O
function. O
There O
are O
no O
obvious O
contraindications O
to O
transplant. O
At O
this O
time, O
we O
are O
not O
planning O
to O
evaluate O
him O
but O
to O
treat O
the O
urgency O
of O
his O
heart O
failure O
decompensation. O
Our O
plan O
is O
to O
hold O
his O
beta-blockers O
and O
ACE O
inhibitors O
for O
now, O
and O
to O
begin O
him O
on O
an O
IV O
diuretic O
infusion. O
We O
will O
proceed O
with O
echocardiogram O
and O
catheterization O
if O
necessary O
to O
determine O
whether O
there O
are O
other O
conditions O
exacerbating O
his O
current O
decompensated O
state. O

Guidelines O
1. O
Check B-SMOKER
blood O
sugars O
before O
meals O
and O
at O
bedtime. O
In O
addition, O
some O
meals O
you O
may O
want O
to O
check O
your O
blood O
sugar O
(blood O
glucose O
or O
BG) O
1 O
hour O
after O
taking O
your O
Novolog. O
If O
it O
is O
over O
150 O
you O
may O
need O
to O
take O
more O
Novolog O
with O
meals O
or O
decrease O
your O
carbohydrate O
intake. O
You O
do O
not O
have O
to O
do O
this O
at O
every O
meal O
and O
you O
can O
alternate O
meals O
and/or O
days. O
For O
example: O
Sat O
check O
before O
and O
after O
breakfast; O
Friday O
- O
lunch; O
Thursday O
- O
supper,etc. O
2. O
Be O
careful O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
carbohydrates O
(breads, O
pasta, O
cereal, O
fruit, O
etc) O
you O
eat O
at O
each O
meal O
and O
between O
meals. O
Try O
to O
average O
about O
60 O
gms. O
per O
meal O
and O
15 O
gms. O
for O
snacks. O
3. O
The O
goal O
for O
your O
blood O
sugars O
when O
you O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
before O
meals O
is O
80-110, O
1 O
hour O
after O
taking O
Novolog O
(at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
meal) O
it O
is O
less O
than O
140, O
and O
at O
bedtime O
100 O
to O
140. O
4. O
Your O
insulin O
may O
need O
adjusting O
several O
times O
before O
those O
goals O
can O
be O
met. O
When O
exercising O
you O
may O
need O
more O
carbs O
or O
less O
Novolog O
with O
meals. O
Long-acting O
insulin: O
Lantus O
(insulin O
glargine) O
Take O
_14_ O
units O
at O
bedtime. O
Do O
not O
mix O
with O
any O
other O
insulin. O
Lantus O
starts O
to O
work O
in O
about O
1 O
hr O
and O
lasts O
about O
24 O
hours. O
It O
has O
no O
peak. O
If O
your O
fasting O
blood O
sugar O
for O
two O
or O
more O
mornings O
is O
more O
than O
120, O
increase O
your O
Lantus O
by O
2 O
units O
at O
the O
next O
dose. O
If O
it O
is O
more O
than O
140 O
for O
two O
mornings O
then O
increase O
by O
4 O
units O
at O
the O
next O
dose. O
If O
your O
fasting O
blood O
sugar O
is O
less O
than O
70 O
then O
decrease O
your O
next O
dose O
of O
Lantus O
by O
2 O
to O

in O
15 O
minutes O
and O
lasts O
about O
2 O
hours. O
It O
peaks O
in O
about O
1 O
hour. O
You O
need O
to O
eat O
enough O
carbs O
to O

thought O
to O
be O
a O
splenic O
subcapsular O
hematoma O
(on O
Coumadin O
for O
chronic O

and O
then O
subsequently O
developed O

Dear B-SMOKER
Dr. O
Colon: O
I O
am O
writing O
to O
inform O
you O
that O
I O
am O
seeing O
Mr. O
Oliver O
Jain O
in O
followup. O
Mr. O
Jain O
was O
admitted O
to O
my O
service O
in O
transfer O
for O
right O
lower O
extremity O
ischemia O
and O
gangrene O
following O
atheroembolization O
from O
a O
popliteal O
aneurysm, O
as O
you O
know. O
He O
was O
admitted O
in O
early O
September O
and O
stayed O
until O
early O
October. O
During O
his O
hospital O
stay O
here O
his O
wounds O
were O
addressed. O
He O
underwent O
angiograms O
to O
evaluate O
his O
arterial O
anatomy O
and O
he O
underwent O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
right O
wherein O
covered O
stent O
graft O
was O
used O
to O
cover O
disease O
in O
his O
proximal O
femoral O
artery O
and O
then O
he O
underwent O
an O
above O
knee O
to O
below O
knee O
popliteal O
artery O
bypass O
using O
PTFE O
with O
ligation O
of O
the O
aneurysm. O
He O
also O
subsequently O
underwent O
angioplasty O
of O
his O
posterior O
tibial O
artery. O
Given O
his O
atheroembolic O
phenomenon O
he O
had O
very O
limited O
vasculature O
remaining O
in O
the O
foot O
and O
I O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
forefoot O
gangrene O
would O
progress O
and O
he O
would O
wind O
up O
losing O
the O
right O
foot. O
In O
the O
interim O
since O
his O
discharge O
he O
appears O
to O
be O
doing O
quite O
well. O
The O
gangrene O
of O
the O
right O
foot O
has O
remained O
stable O
with O
clearcut O
demarcation O
of O
the O
right O
first, O
second O
and O
third O
toes. O
He O
also O
has O
some O
heel O
ulceration O
that O
I O
am O
hoping O
to O
nurse O
through. O
He O
denies O
any O
rest O
pain O
or O
pain O
in O
the O
foot. O
He O
has O
no O
evidence O
of O
fevers, O
chills, O
rigors O
or O
shakes O
in O
the O
interim. O
He O
has O
since O
been O
discharged O
to O
home O
and O
has O
been O
walking O
with O
a O
walking O
shoe. O
His O
left O
lower O
extremity O
aneurysm O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
treated O
and O
he O
has O
not O
developed O
any O
symptoms O
with O
regards O
to O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity. O
He O
has O
been O
taking O
his O
Coumadin O
regularly O
and O
has O
had O
therapeutic O
INRs O
as O
he O
reports. O
On O
exam O
today O
he O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
He O
is O
in O
good O
spirits O
and O
appears O
much O
better O
than O
in O
the O
hospital. O
His O
head O
and O
neck O
exams O
were O
unremarkable. O
His O
lungs O
were O
clear. O
Heart O
was O
regular. O
His O
proximal O
groin O
and O
leg O
incisions O
have O
healed O
up O
nicely, O
however O
there O
is O
some O
dry O
eschar O
on O
the O
midportion O
of O
the O
wound. O
With O
regards O
to O
the O
toes O
he O
has O
clearcut O
demarcation O
and O
heel O
ulceration. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
cellulitis, O
induration O
or O
infection O
of O
the O
right O
lower O
extremity. O
He O
continues O
to O
have O
a O
stable O
looking O
foot O
on O
the O
left. O
Given O
his O
extensive O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
I O
performed O
PVRs O
in O
the O
office O
today, O
which O
revealed O
that O
he O
has O
pulsatile O
PVRs O
at O
the O
right O
calf O
and O
ankle. O
He O
also O
has O
slight O
pulsatile O
PVRs O
at O
the O
right O
transmetatarsal O
level. O
This O
bodes O
well O
with O
regards O
to O
his O
revascularization O
as O
well O
as O
his O
potential O
to O
either O
heal O
or O
remain O
stable O
with O
regards O
to O
the O
necrosis O
on O
the O
right O
foot. O
His O
left O
calf, O
ankle O
and O
transmetatarsal O
PVRs O
were O
similar. O
In O
summary, O
this O
is O
an O
unfortunate O
gentleman O
who O
developed O
atheroembolic O
phenomena O
resulting O
in O
digital O
ischemia O
as O
well O
as O
heel O
ischemia O
with O
the O
potential O
for O
limb O
loss O
in O
the O
near O
future O
of O
the O
right O
lower O
extremity. O
He O
does O
have O
an O
untreated O
aneurysm O
on O
the O
left O
with O
potential O
for O
atheroembolization O
of O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity. O
Given O
this O
concern, O
I O
will O
proceed O
next O
with O
a O
left O
lower O
extremity O
revascularization O
to O
exclude O
the O
popliteal O
aneurysm O
so O
that O
he O
does O
not O
develop O
limb-threatening O
gangrene O
of O
the O
left. O
With O
regards O
to O
the O
right O
I O
will O
try O
to O
initiate O
some O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
therapy O
and O
will O
probably O
re-evaluate O
his O
distal O
circulation O
with O
an O
angiogram O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
next O
admission O
or O
some O
time O
thereafter. O
I O
am O
hoping O
to O
facilitate O
healing O
of O
the O
heel O
wound O
with O
the O
final O
outcome O
of O
a O
transmetatarsal O
amputation O
of O
the O
right O
lower O
extremity O
but O
will O
see O
how O
it O
goes. O
My O
thanks O
again O
for O
this O
referral. O
I O
apologize O
for O
not O
sending O
you O
correspondence O
earlier. O
With O
this O

I O
will O

However, O

not O

Clinical O
picture O
very O
suggestive O
of O
systemic O

At O
this O
time O
she O
does O
not O
have O
an O
absolute O
indication O
for O
sarcoid O
treatment O
but O
she O
may O
benefit O
symptomatically O
from O
low O

At O
this O

she O
is O
reluctant O
to O
start O
steroids O
without O
discussing O
it O
with O
her O
family O
and O
Dr. O
Villalpando. O
Recommendations: O
-Would O
consider O
Cardiac O
MRI O
given O
her O
hx O
of O

as O
cardiac O
sarcoid O
is O
an O
absolute O
indication O
for O
treatment. O
-Would O
recommend O
checking O

-Would O
recommend O
starting O

Will O
discuss O
this O
further O
with O

tomorrow. O
There O
is O
no O

at O

we O
could O

is O
available O
to O
speak O
with O
Mrs. O

-Would O

Re: O

Dear O
Dr. O
Kay: O
I O
saw O
Dalila O
Haynes O
today O
in O
consultation O
concerning O
the O
possibility O
of O
neurosarcoidosis. O
She O
comes O
with O
her O
daughter O
who O
assists O
with O
the O
history. O
I O
will O
review O
her O
history O
for O
the O
record. O
She O
is O
a O
69-year-old O
right-handed O
woman O
who O
was O
hospitalized O
at O
the O
Promptcare O
in O
July O
2103 O
for O
evaluation O
of O
mental O
and O
motor O
slowing, O
memory O
loss, O
and O
weight O
loss. O
Her O
daughter O
notes O
that O
she O
had O
deteriorated O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
month O
or O
two. O
Her O
movements O
slowed O
down, O
and O
she O
became O
unsteady O
on O
her O
feet, O
and O
her O
memory O
deteriorated. O
This O
culminated O
in O
a O
fall O
in O
July O
prompting O
her O
hospitalization. O
During O
that O
hospitalization O
a O
head O
CT O
on O
7/25/03 O
was O
reported O
unremarkable. O
(There O
is O
mild O
ventriculomegaly O
on O
it.) O
An O
MRI O
of O
the O
brain O
on O
7/28 O
showed O
a O
few O
dots O
of O
restricted O
diffusion O
in O
the O
left O
thalamus. O
There O
was O
no O
abnormal O
enhancement. O
This O
was O
consistent O
with O
small O
vessel O
stroke. O
EEG O
showed O
generalized O
slowing O
of O
the O
background O
in O
the O
theta O
and O
delta O
range O
with O
no O
epileptiform O
features. O
An O
LP O
showed O
normal O
glucose O
(74), O
elevated O
protein O
(102), O
lymphocytic O
pleocytosis O
(18-20 O
WBC, O
56-69% O
lymphocytes, O
29-40% O
monocytes, O
and O
2-4% O
neutrophils) O
and O
0-1 O
RBC. O
CSF O
ACE O
was O
normal. O
Cultures O
were O
negative. O
CSF O
VDRL O
was O
negative. O
Because O
she O
has O
a O
history O
of O
sarcoidosis, O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
this O
likely O
represented O
neurosarcoidosis. O
She O
was O
started O
on O
prednisone O
40 O
mg O
daily. O
Her O
daughter O
has O
noted O
some O
improvement O
in O
her O
movements O
and O
cognition O
since O
starting O
the O
prednisone, O
but O
she O
remains O
abnormal. O
She O
has O
lowered O
the O
prednisone O
to O
10 O
mg O
daily O
now. O
Reviewing O
the O
laboratory O
studies O
today, O
I O
see O
that O
although O
an O
RPR O
was O
non-reactive, O
a O
TA-IgG O
was O
positive, O
and O
the O
confirming O
treponemal O
tests O
(FTA) O
was O
also O
positive O
at O
the O
state O
lab. O
She O
and O
her O
daughter O
are O
aware O
of O
no O
prior O
history O
of O
syphilis. O
Other O
studies O
during O
her O
hospitalization O
included O
low O
serum O
Na O
(133) O
and O
Mg O
(1.3), O
normal O
vitamin O
B12, O
folate, O
TSH, O
and O
ESR O
(20). O
CSF O
HSV O
PCR O
was O
negative. O
HbA1C B-DIABETES
was I-DIABETES
elevated I-DIABETES
at I-DIABETES
8.6. I-DIABETES
She O
has O
a O
history O
of O
asthma O
going O
back O
many O
years. O
According O
to O
her O
daughter, O
she O
had O
a O
skin O
lesion O
excised O
from O
near O
her O
left O
eye O
about O
two O
years O
ago. O
Apparently, O
this O
showed O
noncaseated O
granuloma, O
and O
that O
is O
when O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis O
was O
first O
made. O
She O
then O
had O
a O
mediatinoscopy O
on O
4/10/02. O
Biopsy O
of O
mediastinal O
nodes O
showed O
granulomatous O
inflammation O
without O
caseating O
necrosis, O
supporting O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis. O
She O
has O

Her O
treponemal O
test O
for O
syphilis O
came O
back O
positive O
from O
the O
hospitalization O
in O
July. O
Since O
syphilis, O
too, O
could O
cause O
noncaseating O
granulomas, O
and O
she O
has O
clearly O
has O
syphilis O
at O
some O
point O
in O
the O
past O
which O
was O
probably O
untreated, O
this O
raises O
some O
doubt O
about O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis. O
I O
will O
review O
that O
issue O
with O
you O
and O
with O
Dr, O
Villalpando. O
She O
had O
CSF O
pleocytosis O
in O
July. O
With O
that O
and O
the O
positive O
treponemal O
test O
(FTA), O
she O
will O
need O
a O
full O
course O
of O
intravenous O
penicillin O
for O
presumed O
neurosyphilis. O
I O
will O
discuss O
arrangements O
for O
possible O
outpatient O
management O
of O
hatt O
with O
a O
PICC O
line O
and O
outpatient O
VNA O
services. O
Concerning O
her O
need O
for O
prednisone, O
I O
think O
that O
will O
depend O
on O
our O
interpretation O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis O
in O
light O
of O
this O
new O
diagnosis. O
If O
the O
evidence O
of O
sarcoidosis O
is O
not O
strong O
with O
this O
alternative O
diagnosis, O
then O
we O
can O
plan O
to O
complete O
the O
course O
of O
penicillin O
and O
taper O
and O
discontinue O
the O
prednisone O
and O
then O
follow O
her O
clinical O
course, O
her O
CSF, O
and O
her O
syphilis O
serologies. O
Finally, O
from O
the O
MRI O
of O
7/28, O
shows O
a O
couple O
of O
tiny O
foci O
of O
restricted O
diffusion O
in O
the O
left O
thalamus. O
These O
are O
most O
consistent O
with O
small O
vessel O
ischemic O
strokes. O
She O
has O
multiple O
risk O
factors O
for O
common O
small O
vessel O
disease O
and O
stroke, O
but O
in O
the O
context O
of O
her O
inflammatory O
CSF O
and O
evidence O
of O
prior O
syphilis, O
we O
must O
also O
consider O
cerebrovascular O
syphilis O
as O
the O
likely O
cause O
of O
this. O
I O
would O
recommend O
treatment O
now O
with O
a O
14-day O
course O
of O
high-dose O
(20-24 O
million O
units O
a O
day) O
penicillin. O
She O
is O
already O
on O
prednisone O
which O
might O
help O
to O
prevent O
any O
possible O
Jarisch-Herxheimer O
reaction. O
I O
think O
that O
if O
she O
remains O
stable O
after O
the O
initiation O
of O
her O
PCN O
therapy, O
then O
we O
can O
plan O
to O
taper O
and O
then O
discontinue O
the O
prednisone, O
to O
follow O
her O
clinically O
and O
with O
repeated O
LP, O
and O
determine O
any O
need O
for O
future O
corticosteroid O
therapy O
on O
her O
course. O
Thank O
you O
for O
this O
consultation. O

several O

Her O
prior O

was O
thought O
to O
be O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
neurosyphillis O
as O
detailed O
above, O
though O
there O
was O
still O
the O
possibility O
of O
neurosarcoid. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
a O
repeat O
LP O
to O
assess O
for O
resolution O
of O
prior O
abnormalities, O
and O
now O
that O
she O
has O
a O
recurrence O
of O
symptoms, O
she O
should O
have O
repeat O
LP. O
She O
should O
also O
have O
an O
MRI O
as O
a O
thalamic O
or O
frontal O
stroke O
is O
another O
possible O
etiology. O
This O
could O
be O
a O
more O
global O
failure O
to O
thrive O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
deconditioning O
followed O
by O
poor O
PO's, O
but O
this O
should O
be O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
exclusion. O
CXR O
raises O
a O
question O
of O
retrocardiac O
opacity O
suggesting O
possible O
PNA, O
but O
with O
normal O
WBC, O
no O
URI O
sx's O
or O

and O
no O
fever, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
she O
has O
PNA O
and O
will O
follow O
clinically. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Ms. O
Haynes O
is O
a O
69-year-old O
woman O
who O
comes O
in O
followup O
of O
her O
recent O
hospitalization O
and O
rehabilitation. O
She O
is O
here O
with O
her O
daughter. O
She O
notes O
that O
she O
is O
mostly O
feeling O
tired O
lately. O
She O
is O
able O
to O
walk O
with O
help O
and O
is O
even O
unable O
to O
walk O
upstairs O
with O
assistance. O
She O
is O
here O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
and O
says O
she O
is O
kind O
of O
tired O
and O
lets O
her O
daughter O
gives O
most O
of O
the O
history O
even O
when O
asked O
simple O
questions. O
She O
has O
been O
checking O
her O
blood O
sugars O
and O
she O
shows O
me O
the O
results. O
In O
the O
morning, O
the O
sugars O
have O
been O
fairly O
low O
in O
the O
57-100 O
range, O
around O
noontime O
high O
at O
144 O
up O
to O
398, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
high O
again O
176-245. O
She O
is O
taking O
Lantus B-MEDICATION
38 O
units O
at O
9:00 O
p.m. O
and O
she O
is O
on O

less O
than O
25-0 O
units, O
125-152 O
units, O
151-204 O
units, O
201-256 O
units, O
251-308 O
units O
and O
greater O
than O
310 O
units. O
She O
would O
like O
to O
switch O
over O
her O
Lantus O
to O
the O
Pens O
since O
the O
pen O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
for O
her. O
She O
complains O
of O
hemorrhoids, O
although O
she O
says O
they O
are O
actually O
getting O
better, O
she O
had O
previously O
had O
four O
now O
she O
has O
two. O
There O
is O
no O
bleeding. O
There O
is O
no O
pain, O
kind O
of O
itchy O
and O
uncomfortable. O
She O
is O
in O
fact O
not O
having O
any O
problem O
with O
constipation O
at O
this O
time. O
She O
is O
having O
bowel O
movements O
every O
day. O
She O
is O
not O
having O
any O
chest O
pain, O
no O
trouble O
breathing, O
no O
fevers, O
sweats O
or O
chills. O
No O
abdominal O
symptoms. O
She O
notes O
her O
stomach O
is O
really O
fine O
and O
it O
just O
not O
causing O
any O
trouble O
at O
all. O

woman, O
English O
speaking O
and O
sitting O
in O
a O

Quite O
alert, O
did O
know O
the O
president, O
could O
not O
recall O
the O
vice-president O
or O
against O
whom O
the O
president O
ran O
in O
the O
last O
election. O
She O
did O
know O
the O
day O
of O
the O
week O
and O
she O
knew O
where O
she O
was. O
She O
also O
remembered O
to O
remind O
me O
about O
a O
prescription O
when O
both O
her O
daughter O
and O
I O
almost O
forgot. O
She O
is O
an O
absolutely O
delightful O
woman, O
appears O
well O
and O
alert O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
lets O
her O
daughter O
provides O
most O
of O
the O
history O
and O
responses. O
She O
appears O
comfortable, O
breathing O

Extremities: O
Without O

no O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Diabetes. B-DIABETES
Her O
A1c B-DIABETES
today I-DIABETES
was I-DIABETES
6.6, I-DIABETES
which O
represents O
excellent O
control O
despite O
a O
fairly O
high O
glucoses O
she O
was O
recording. O
I O
therefore O
did O
not O
want O
to O
increase O
her O
regimen O
despite O
the O
high O
glucoses. O
We O
will O
continue O
for O
now. O
I O
did O
give O
her O
an O
appointment O
with O
the O
diabetes O
nurse O
for O
help O
in O
management O
of O
her O
diabetes. O
2. O
Hypertension. B-HYPERTENSION
Her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
fine. O
We O
will O
continue O
current O
regimen. O
We O
will O
check O
electrolytes. O
3. O
Tachycardia O
actually O
improved O
relative O
to O
her O
last O
visit. O
She O
is O
asymptomatic O
in O
this O
regard O
except O
for O
some O
fatigue. O
4. O
Fatigue. O
This O
is O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
stepping O
down O
from O
the O
prednisone O
60-40. O
This O
is O
what O
the O
patient O
and O
her O
daughter O
believe. O
She O
was O
somewhat O
fatigued O
before, O
but O
they O
note O
that O
it O
is O
worse O
with O
this. O
She O
does O
need O
to O
come O
off O
the O
prednisone O
and O
Dr. O
Villalpando O
who O
she O
just O
saw O
is O
going O
to O
try O
to O
come O
up O
with O
another O
plan O
for O
her. O
Check O

and O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
able O
to O
come O
off O
of O
that O
and O
perhaps O
get O
started O
on O
something O
else. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
The O
patient O
is O
a O
complicated O
72-year-old O
woman O
who O
has O
a O
history O
significant O
for O
porcine O
aortic O
valve O
replacement O
in O
January O
of O
2080 O
at O
Madison O
Medical O
Center O
for O
aortic O
stenosis. O
She O
also O
has O
a O
history O
of O
interstitial O
lung O
disease, O
maintained O
on O
prednisone O
slow O
taper. O
She O
also O
has O
hypertension B-HYPERTENSION
and O
hyperlipidemia. B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
She O
had O
been O
residing O
at O
a O
nursing O
home O
and O
complained O
of O
chest O
pain, O
jaw O
pain O
and O
bilateral O
shoulder O
pain O
for O
approximately O
1 O
week. O
Eventually, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
Wheeling O
Clinic. O
Here O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department, O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
be O
hypotensive O
with O
a O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
in O
the O
70s, O
which O
improved O
to O
the O
90s O
with O
volume O
and O
blood O
resuscitation. O
She O
also O
found O
to O
be O
tachycardic O
and O
have O
a O
hematocrit O
of O
25%. O
The O
patient O
was O
also O
found O
to O
be O
guaiac O
positive O
on O
stool O
occult O
blood. O
Her O
troponin O
was O
mildly O
elevated. O
The O
patient O
was O
transfused O
with O
several O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
and O
her O
chest O
discomfort O
has O
improved. O
She O
also O
underwent O
echocardiography O
on O
03/26/80, O
which O
was O
a O
fair O
quality O
study O
with O
a O
mildly O
dilated O
left O
ventricle, O
mild O
LVH, O
septal O
flattening O
consistent O
with O
RV O
pressure O
overload O
and O
an O
estimated O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
35% O
to O
40%. O
Diastolic O
dysfunction O
was O
also O
noted. O
There O
was O
dilatation O
of O
both O
atria O
and O
the O
right O
ventricle O
with O
mildly O
reduced O
RV O
systolic O
function. O
The O
aortic O
valve O
could O
not O
be O
well O
visualized. O
There O
was O
reduced O
cusp O
excursion O
with O
severe O
aortic O
stenosis. O
There O
was O
mild O
tricuspid O
regurgitation O
and O
estimated O
PASP O
of O
60 O
to O
65 O
mmHg O
plus O
RA O
pressure. O
There O
was O
mild-to-moderate O
mitral O
regurgitation O
with O
a O
posteriorly O
directed O
jet. O
The O
aortic O
valve O
peak O
gradient O
was O
115.6 O
mmHg O
and O
mean O
gradient O
was O
77.05 O
mmHg. O
Valve O
area O
was O
not O
calculated. O
The O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
Madison O
Medical O
Center O
for O
treatment O
of O
her O
symptoms. O
She O
notes O
that O
her O
chest O
pain O
has O
improved. O
She O
notes O
that O
she O
had O
worsening O
of O
her O
baseline O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath O
at O
rest O
starting O
in O

IMPRESSION: O
A O
72-year-old O
woman O
with O
congestive O
heart O
failure, O
recent O
echocardiogram O
suggesting O
severe O
aortic O
stenosis O
and O
her O
bioprosthetic O
aortic O
valve O
replacement O
for O
AS O
back O
in O
2080 O
and O
GI O
bleed O
with O
significant O
anemia, O
now O
transfused O
and O
improved. O
The O
patient O
also O
has O
chronic O
interstitial O
lung O
disease O
for O
which O
she O
is O
on O
chronic O
steroid O
therapy. O
I O
think O
the O
main O
issue O
is O
to O
determine O
whether O
there O
is O
significant O
aortic O
stenosis O
that O
may O
require O
re-intervention. O
On O
exam, O
most O
features O
are O
not O
consistent O
with O
severe O
aortic O
stenosis, O
so O
we O
will O
repeat O
the O
echocardiogram O
here O
and O
determine O
if O
there O
is O
severe O
aortic O
stenosis O
in O
the O
bioprosthetic O
valve, O
and O
if O
so, O
what O
is O
the O
pathology. O
Depending O
on O
this, O
we O
will O
determine O
whether O
the O
patient O
needs O
surgical O
reoperation. O
If O
so, O
she O
will O
need O
to O
have O
her O
GI O
tract O
looked O
that O
first O
for O
the O
source O
of O
GI O
bleeding O
in O
order O
to O
treat O
this O
in O
preparation O
for O
repeat O
cardiac O
surgery. O
In O
addition, O
the O
patient O
will O
be O
treated O
for O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
with O
increased O
diuretics, O
following O
her O
inputs O
and O
outputs, O
daily O
weights, O
basal O
metabolic O
panel, O
exam O
and O
chest O
x-ray. O
Her O
beta-blocker O
will O
be O
increased O
due O
to O
her O
recent O
myocardial O
event, O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
her O
CHF O
in O
order O
to O
not O
worsen O
it. O
Beta-blocker O
will O
be O
gradually O
increased O
given O
the O
lung O
disease O
and O
congestive O
heart O
failure. O
Endocarditis O
will O
be O
ruled O
out O
with O
serial O
blood O
cultures. O

in O

with O
Dr. O
Vicente O
Noel O
on O
04/22/2085. O
Betty O
Gillis O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
73-year-old O
woman O
who O
was O
recently O
admitted O
to O
the O
Griffin O
Memorial O
Hospital O
in O
early O
February O
2085 O
with O
a O
right O
MCA O
territory O
stroke O
characterized O
clinically O
by O
drooling O
and O
left O
hand O
weakness. O
Fortunately, O
her O
symptoms O
have O
now O
resolved O
and O
she O
is O
back O
to O
her O
regular O
activities. O
We O
understand O
that O
she O
has O
also O
had O
previous O
strokes. O
In O
December O
2082, O
she O
was O
suffering O
a O
dizzy O
spell O
and O
subsequently O
an O
MRI O
of O
her O
brain O
found O
a O
posterior O
circulation O
cerebellar O
infarct O
as O
well O
as O
a O
couple O
of O
basal O
ganglia O
lacunar O
infarct. O
She O
recalls O
having O
only O
V2 O
clinical O
events. O
She O
was O
worked O
up O
in O
the O
Griffin O
Memorial O
Hospital O
and O
had O
a O
Holter, O
which O
demonstrated O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
minor O
ectopy O
only, O
an O
echocardiogram, O
which O
was O
reported O
as O
essentially O
normal O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
positive O
saline O
contrast O
bubble O
study O
suggesting O
a O
patent O
foramen O
ovale, O
an O
MRI O
of O
her O
head O
which O
demonstrated O
the O
infarct O
and O
marked O
microvascular O
disease, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
CT O
angiogram O
of O
her O
head O
and O
neck O
arteries, O
which O
demonstrated O
mild O
atheroma O
for O
the O
most O
part O
with O
a O
left O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
stenosis O
that O
was O
less O
than O
50%. O
She O
is O
referred O
to O
us O
today O
for O
an O
opinion O
as O
to O
how O
to O
manage O
the O
possible O
patent O
foramen O
ovale. O
This O
lady O
has O
never O
had O
cardiac O
problems O
otherwise. O
There O
is O
no O
history O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation, O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
or O
congestive O

She O
does O
not O
get O
exertional O
chest O

(chest O
pain O
or O
shortness O
of O
breath) O
and O
has O
no O
history O
of O
syncope O
or O
presyncope. O
She O
has O
no O
history O
of O
PND, O
orthopnea O
or O
edema. O
She O
remains O
fairly O
active O
despite O
her O
ataxic O
gait. O
She O
tells O
me O
that O
she O
is O
able O
to O
walk O
several O
blocks O
without O
difficulty O
and O
never O
has O
any O
exertional O
chest O

Moreover, O
she O

very O
much O
about O
her O

She O
believes O
that O
her O

father O
suffered O
a O
stroke O
at O
some O
point, O
but O
cannot O
say O
for O
certain O
how O
old O
he O
was. O
Social O
History: O
This O
woman O
is O
single. O
She O
is O
a O
retired O
Secretary. O
She O
is O
an O
ex-smoker O
(more O
than O
40 O
pack O
years), O
but O
does O
not O
drink O
significant O
amounts O
of O
alcohol. O
She O
has O
no O
other O
history O
of O
substance O
abuse. O
Review O
of O
Systems: O
Functional O
inquiry O
is O
positive O
for O
difficulties O
with O
psoriasis O
that O
are O
chronic O
and O
ongoing. O
She O
has O
no O
other O
new O
symptoms. O
There O
is O
no O
recent O
GI O
bleeding. O
She O
has O
difficulties O
with O
bladder O
incontinence O
as O
well. O
On O
physical O
examination O
today, O
her O
heart O
rate O
is O
86 O
beats O
per O
minute O
and O
regular O
and O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
122/78 O
in O
the O
right O
arm O
and O
124/80 O
in O
the O
left O
arm. O
Respiratory O
rate O
is O
20 O
and O
she O
is O
pink O
on O
room O
air. O
Head O
and O
neck O
exam O
is O
unremarkable. O
There O
are O
no O
carotid O
bruits. O
She O
has O
some O
kyphoscoliosis O
of O
her O
spine. O
Her O
chest O
examination O
reveals O
no O
dullness O
to O
percussion O
and O
vesicular O
breath O
sounds O
only. O
Her O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
is O
not O
elevated. O
Central O
pulses O
are O
normal O
in O
volume O
and O
contour. O
Her O
apex O
beat O
is O
within O
normal O
limits. O
Heart O
sounds O
include O
a O
normal O
S1 O
and O
S2 O
with O
no O
murmurs. O
Her O
abdomen O
is O
soft O
and O
nontender. O
There O
are O
no O
obvious O
masses. O
Her O
aorta O
does O
not O
obviously O
appear O
to O
be O
enlarged. O
Her O
pulses O
are O
palpable O
in O
her O
groin, O
but O
hard O
to O
feel O
behind O
her O
knees O
and O
distally. O
They O
are O
symmetrical. O
Informally, O
ABI O
test O
was O
not O
done O
today O
because O
she O
has O
several O
weeping O
eczematous O
lesions O
on O
her O
legs, O
which O
reflects O
psoriasis O
that O
has O
been O
excoriated. O
A O
brief O
neurologic O
exam O
reveals O
dysmetria O
worse O
on O
the O
left O
than O
the O
right. O
Impression: O
Betty O
Gillis O
has O
had O
at O
least O
four O
strokes O
and O
has O
documented O
evidence O
of O
atherosclerotic O
vascular O
disease O
and O
cerebromicrovascular O
disease O
on O
recent O
imaging. O
We O
reviewed O
the O
echocardiogram O
today O
and O
we O
wished O
to O
confirm O
with O
the O
reading O
echocardiographer O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
positive. O
(It O
does O
not O
look O
particularly O
positive O
to O
our O
eyes). O
Certainly, O
if O
she O
does O
not O
indeed O
have O
a O
patent O
foramen O
ovale, O
there O
is O
no O
issue O
as O
to O
what O
to O
do O
about O
it. O
If O
she O
does O
have O
one; O
however, O
it O
seems O
more O
likely O
that O
her O
strokes O
reflect O
her O
atherosclerotic O
vascular O
disease O
secondary O
to O
her O
atherosclerotic O
risk O
factors O
and O
that O
the O
bulk O
of O
treatment O
should O
be O
directed O
at O
modulating O
those. O
Her O
hypertension O
is O
controlled O
today. O
Her O
dyslipidemia O
is O
not O
bad. O
However, O
the O
LDL O
is O
76 O
and O
perhaps O
there O
is O
some O
added O
benefit O
to O
increasing O
her O
simvastatin O
to O
80 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily. O
We O
also O
note O
that O
she O
has O
had O
elevated O
glucoses O
in O
the O
past, O
as O
high O
as O
191, O
as O
well O
as O
an O
elevated B-DIABETES
hemoglobin I-DIABETES
A1c I-DIABETES
up I-DIABETES
to I-DIABETES
6.5. I-DIABETES
It O
is O
probably O
worth O
having O
her O
screen O
formally O
to O
see O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
has O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus O
versus O
insulin O
insensitivity O
only. O
She O
may O
benefit O
from O
an O
oral O
hypoglycemic. O
We O
recommend. O
1. O
We O
will O
review O
the O
echocardiogram O
with O
the O
reading O
echocardiographer O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
does O
indeed O
show O
a O
patent O
foramen O
ovale. O
2. O
We O
suggest O
that O
she O
increase O
her O
statin O
from O
simvastatin O
40 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily O
to O
simvastatin O
80 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily. O
We O
will O
leave O
this O
to O
her O
primary O
care O
physician O
to O
organize. O
3. O
We O
suggest O
that O
she O
be O
screened O
formally O
for O
diabetes O
mellitus O
type O
2. O
We O
will O
see O
her O
again O
as O
necessary, O
but O
for O
the O
time O
being, O
we O
have O
no O
plans O
to O
perform O
an O
intervention O
on O
this O
lady. O

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: O
The O
patient O
is O
a O
74 O
yo O
female O
with O
poorly O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
hypertension, O
and O
hyperlipidemia O
who O
presents O
with O
acute O

and O
nausea O
and O

1. O
Glaucoma. O
Likely O
secondary O
to O
proliferative O
diabetic O

As O
recommended O
by O
the O
ophthalmologic O
consultant, O
I O
will O
give O
the O

-Timolol B-MEDICATION
BID O
-Trusopt O
BID O

IOP O
will O
be O
monitored O
closely. O
If O
it O
does O
not O
trend O
down, O
the O
patient O
may O
need O
surgery O
in O
the O
AM. O
2. O
Nausea O
and O
Vomiting O
The O
differential O
diagnosis O
is O
broad O
and O
includes O
symptoms O
related O
to O
glaucoma, O
atypical O
angina, O
symptoms O
from O
an O
SBO O
given O
her O
history, O
chemical O
pancreatitis O
and O
viral O
gastroenteritis. O
Of O
these, O
I O
believe O
that O
symptoms O
from O
glaucoma O
or O
gastroenteritis O
is O
most O
likely. O
- O
I O
ordered O
a O
KUB O
on O
the O
floor O
which O
showed O
normal O
bowel O
gas O
per O
unofficial O
rads O
read. O
- O
I O
think O
angina O
is O
unlikely O
given O
her O
history. O
However, O
I O
believe O
that O
she O
needs O
a O
stress O
test O
given O
her O
severe O
diabetes. O
I O
will O
be O
unable O
to O
arrange O
one O
for O
tomorrow O
(weekend O
day), O
but O
I O
believe O
she O
needs O
one O
as O
an O
out O
patient O
study O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
I O
will O
give O
ASA, O
B O

and O
ACE. O
I O
will O
not O
give O
heparin O
given O
that O
her O
TIMI O
score O
is O
only O
1. O
- O
Chemical O
pancreatitis O
is O
possible O
although O
her O
exam O
is O
so O
bengin. O
I O
will O
therefore O
give O

and O
follow O
her O
for O

symptoms. O

Dear B-SMOKER
Nurse O
Rivas, O
We O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Ruath O
Doss O
(MRN O
49535763) O
back O
in O
Neurology O
Clinic O
today O
for O
stroke O
and O
subsequent O
seizures. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
myself O
and O
Dr. O
Franklin O
Feliciano. O
Ruath O
Doss O
is O
a O
58yo O
RHF O
with O
a O
history O
of O
poorly O
controlled O
DM, B-DIABETES
htn, B-HYPERTENSION
and O
hypercholesterolemia B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
who O
is O
followed O
here O
in O
Neurology O
clinic O
for O
multiple O
small O
L O
frontoparietal O
strokes O
complicated O
by O
seizures. O
She O
was O
last O
seen O
here O
March O
4th, O
at O
which O
time O
she O
was O
having O
difficulty O
tasting O
food. O
This O
finding O
was O
not O
replicated O
on O
clinical O
exam, O
and O
her O
exam O
was O
otherwise O
unremarkable; O
it O
was O
theorized O
that O
her O
symptoms O
may O
have O
been O
due O
to O
a O
drastic O
alteration O
in O
her O
diet. O
Less O
likely O
possibilities O
included O
a O
viral O
illness O
and O
side O
effect O
of O
hydrochlorthiazide. B-MEDICATION
Otherwise, O
she O
had O
recovered O
well O
from O
her O
strokes, O
and O
had O
not O
had O
additional O
seizures. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
continues O
to O
do O
well. O
She O
reports O
that O
her O
taste O
came O
back O
eventually; O
she O
did O
stop O
the O
hydrochlorthiazide O
under O
your O
direction, O
but O
is O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
taste. O
She O
continues O
to O
eat O
healthfully, O
and O
in O
fact O
has O
lost O
30 O
lbs O
since O
her O
hospitalization. O
Via O
your O
office, O
she O
has O
completed O
a O
cardiac O
stress O
test O
as O
recommended O
after O
suffering O
a O
NSTEMI B-CAD
during I-CAD
her I-CAD
last I-CAD
hospitalization. I-CAD
She O
has O
had O
an O
abdominal O
ultrasound O
which O
may O
have O
shown O
a O
gallstone, O
although O
she O
is O
unsure O
of O
the O
exact O
results. O
Finally, O
she O
informs O
me O
that O
an O
appointment O
with O
Dr. O
Yuhas O
of O
Neurosurgery O
has O
been O
scheduled O
for O
August O
in O
order O
to O
follow O
up O
an O
incidental O
small O
L O
A2 O
aneurysm. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
continues O
to O
take O
Plavix B-MEDICATION
for O
secondary O
stroke O
prevention O
(she O
has O
G6PD O
deficiency). O
Her O
dentist O
would O
like O
to O
take O
her O
off O
this O
medication O
for O
a O
week O
before O
an O
extensive O
outpatient O
procedure O
which O
would O
include O
deep O
root O
cleaning. O
However, O
she O
is O
nervous O
about O
the O
risk O
of O
another O
stroke. O
She O
continues O
to O
tolerate O
her O
Dilantin O
well; O
there O
had O
been O
a O
question O
in O
April O
about O
a O
low O
level, O
but O
the O
test O
had O
been O
inadvertently O
performed O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
a O
held O
dose, O
and O
on O
repeat O
testing O
was O
within O
goal O
at O
12.6. O
She O
denies O
any O
seizure-like O
activity: O
no O
staring O
or O
shaking O
spells, O
or O
episodes O
of O
incontinence O
or O
tongue O
biting. O
She O
reminds O
me O
that O
her O
6 O
month O
anniversary O
of O
seizure O
free O
activity O
is O
approaching, O
and O
thus O
is O
hoping O
that O
she O
might O
be O
able O
to O
resume O
driving. O
She O
denies O
changes O
in O
vision, O
focal O
weakness O
or O
numbness, O
difficulty O
with O
language O
comprehension O
or O
production. O
She O
does O
have O
occasional O
mild O
headaches O
exacerbated O
by O
the O
summer O
heat. O
She O
sometimes O
feels O
as O
though O
she O
has O
'creepy O
crawly O
things O
in O
my O
head,' O
a O
sensation O
similar O
to O
when O
she O

returns O
to O
Neurology O
clinic O
for O
stroke O
complicated O
by O
seizures. O
She O
is O
overall O
doing O
very O
well, O
and O
has O
been O
very O
meticulous O
with O
her O
healthcare O
after O
her O
hospitalizations O
in O
December. O
We O
discussed O
the O
very O
small O
risk O
of O
stroke O
if O
Plavix O
is O
held O
for O
a O
dental O
procedure. O
The O
daily O
risk O
of O
stroke O
is O
so O
small, O
and O
the O
benefit O
of O
proper O
mouth O
care O
so O
great, O
that O
we O
would O
agree O
with O
holding O
clopidogrel. O
If O
she O
does O
not O
want O
to O
stop O
antiplatelet O
medication O
before O
the O
procedure, O
the O
only O
alternative O
would O
be O
a O
heparin O
or O
Lovenox O
bridge. O
However, O
such O
a O
measure O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
extreme, O
especially O
as O
her O
overwhelming O
stroke O
risk O
factors O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
CVA O
were O
her O
diabetes, B-DIABETES
hypertension, B-HYPERTENSION
and O
hypercholesterolemia, O
all O
of O
which O
she O
has O
taken O
significant O
strides O
to O
better O
control. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
was O
still O
nervous O
about O
suspending O
the O
Plavix; O
ultimately, O
she O
will O
decide O
on O
the O
optimal O
course O
of O
action. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
will O
have O
repeat O
cholesterol O
panel O
tested O
at O
your O
office O
to O
assess O
her O
response O
to O
the O
increased O
dose O
Lipitor O
and O
dietary O
changes. O
Her O
lipoprotein(a) O
level O
was O
high O
at O
89 O
at O
the O
time O
of O
her O
hospitalization, O
and O
we O
will O
repeat O
this O
lab O
today O
to O
ascertain O
whether O
it O
has O
remained O
elevated. O
I O
have O
also O
written O
her O
a O
letter O
certifying O
that, O
as O
of O
July O
3rd, O
she O
will O
have O
been O
seizure O
free O
for O
6 O
months O
time O
on O
a O
stable O
dose O
of O
Dilantin. O
She O
emphasizes O
that O
she O
would O
call O
my O
office O
or O
go O
to O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
immediately O
if O
there O
she O
were O
to O
have O
any O
seizure-like O
episodes. O
If O
she O
remains O
event O
free O
for O
two O
years, O
we O
may O
consider O
discontinuing O
her O
antiepileptic O
medication. O
Although O
the O
incidentally O
noted O
L O
A2 O
aneurysm O
is O
reassuringly O
stable O
on O
CTA, O
I O
have O
asked O
her O
to O
confirm O
her O
follow O
up O
appointment O
with O
Neurosurgery, O
as O
I O
do O
not O
see O
the O
date O
noted O
in O
the O
computer. O
Finally, O
we O
will O
obtain O
a O
repeat O
carotid O
ultrasound O
this O
fall O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
irregular O
R O
ICA O
plaque O
has O
not O
progressed. O
Of O
note, O
Dr. O
Franklin O
Feliciano O
was O
present O
for O
all O
of O
the O
salient O
aspects O
of O
the O
history O
and O
physical O
exam. O
Together, O
we O
discussed O
with O
the O
patient O
the O
work-up O
and O
treatment O
plan. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
us O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
your O
patient. O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O

in O
4-6 O

It O
lasted O
3-4 O
seconds O
and O
then O

she O
noticed O

seconds O
and O
then O
resolved O
completely, O
and O

then O
that O
resolved O

seconds O
and O

Dear O
Nurse O
Rivas, O
We O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Ruath O
Doss O
(MRN O
49535763) O
back O
in O
Neurology O
Clinic O
today O
for O
stroke O
and O
subsequent O
seizures. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
myself O
and O
Dr. O
Isaac O
Ferraro. O
Ruath O
Doss O
is O
a O
60yo O
RHF O
with O
a O
history O
of O
poorly O
controlled O
DM, B-DIABETES
htn, B-HYPERTENSION
hypercholesterolemia, B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
G6PD O
deficiency O
who O
is O
followed O
here O
in O
Neurology O
clinic O
for O
multiple O
small O
L O
frontoparietal O
strokes O
complicated O
by O
seizures. O
She O
had O
recovered O
well O
from O
her O
strokes, O
and O
has O
been O
seizure-free O
for O
two O
years O
on O
Dilantin. O
She O
was O
last O
seen O
here O
in O
December O
2091. O
Since O
that O
visit, O
she O
has O
had O
several O
significant O
health-related O
events: O
her O
breast O
biopsy O
was O
found O
to O
be O
negative, O
and O
she O
also O
underwent O
clipping O
of O
her O
incidentally O
found O
L O
ACA O
aneurysm O
via O
bifrontal O
craniotomy. O
Dr. O
Gertrude O
Fulton O
performed O
this O
procedure O
in O
February O
which O
was O
uneventful. O
However, O
an O
abdominal O
aortic O
aneurysm O
was O
found O
on O
an O
ultrasound O
for O
abdominal O
pain O
(attributed O
to O
biliary O
colic), O
so O
she O
is O
being O
followed O
for O
increase O
in O
size O
of O
the O
aneurysm O
as O
well O
as O
for O
any O
new O
cerebral O
aneurysms. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
still O
has O
some O
occasional O
burning O
pain O
over O
her O
right O
incision O
site, O
helpd O
with O
rubbing O
the O
area. O
She O
had O
some O
bilateral O
lateral O
thigh O
numbness O
after O
the O
surgery, O
a O
recrudescence O
of O
old O
symptoms O
which O
improved O
after O
a O
bowel O
movement O
but O
which O
have O
not O
yet O
completely O
resolved. O
She O
denies O
any O
recent O
seizures. O
After O
discussing O
the O
results O
of O
the O
bone O
densitometry O
test O
with O
you, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
she O
did O
not O
need O
additional O
calcium O
agents. O

returns O
to O
Neurology O
clinic O
for O
stroke O
complicated O
by O
seizures. O
Her O
clinical O
examination O
remains O
intact. O
She O
has O
been O
seizure O
free O
for O
two O
years O
at O
this O
point, O
including O
through O
intracranial O
surgery, O
and O
she O
is O
amenable O
to O
a O
trial O
of O
tapering O
off O
the O
Dilantin. O
Given O
that O
her O
seizures O
occurred O
within O
a O
week O
of O
her O
stroke, O
and O
that O
her O
EEG O
at O
that O
time O
did O
not O
show O
epileptiform O
discharges, O
she O
is O
a O
good O
candidate O
for O
AED O
discontinuation. O
Before O
doing O
so, O
we O
will O
obtain O
a O
baseline O
EEG O
to O
assess O
for O
cortical O
irritability. O
Such O
an O
abnormality O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
detect O
given O
her O
craniotomy; O
if O
the O
breech O
is O
significant, O
she O
would O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O
MEG O
study. O
If O
there O
are O
no O
epileptiform O
discharges, O
we O
can O
institute O
a O
taper O
off O
the O
Dilantin O
(decrease O
by O
100mg O
every O
5 O
days). O
After O
she O
has O
been O
off O
the O
Dilantin O
for O
two O
weeks, O
we O
will O
again O
repeat O
an O
EEG. O
She O
is O
aware O
that O
she O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
drive O
for O
6 O
months O
after O
the O
Dilantin O
is O
stopped, O
and O
that O
there O
is O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
seizures O
especially O
in O
the O
first O
3 O
months. O
We O
discussed O
the O
importance O
of O
weight O
loss, O
as O
well O
as O
continued O
good O
diabetic, O
hypertensive, O
and O
lipid O
control O
for O
stroke O
prevention. O
The O
weight O
loss O
will O
likely O
help O
resolve O
her O
meralgia O
paresthetica O
as O
well. O
(It O
is O
not O
entirely O
clear O
how O
the O
constipation O
related O
to O
her O
symptoms.) O
Given O
the O
new O
irregularity O
on O
her O
most O
recent O
carotid O
ultrasound, O
we O
will O
repeat O
the O
study O
once O
more O
to O
ensure O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
progression. O
Mrs. O
Doss O
will O
call O
me O
after O
her O
EEG O
and O
carotid O
ultrasound O
have O
been O
completed O
so O
that O
we O
can O
discuss O
the O
results, O
and O
also O
to O
determine O
whether O
to O
taper O
off O
the O
Dilantin. O
Of O
note, O
Dr. O
Isaac O
Ferraro O
was O
present O
for O
all O
of O
the O
salient O
aspects O
of O
the O
history O
and O
physical O
exam. O
Together, O
we O
discussed O
with O
the O
patient O
the O
work-up O
and O
treatment O
plan. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
us O
to O
continue O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
your O
patient. O
As O
I O
am O
graduating O
from O

she O
will O
be O

The O
patient's O
blood O
sugars O
have O
been O
dropping. O
The O
patient O
has O
decreased O
her O
glipizide B-MEDICATION
already O
from O
20 O

to O
10 O

I O
will O
further O

Check O
hemoglobin O

today O
as O
well O
as O
ALT, O

2. O
Chronic O
renal O

The O
patient's O
creatinine O
clearance O
is O
about O
15-17, O
and O
the O
patient O
is O
approaching O
end-stage O
renal O

She O
is O
being O
followed O
by O
the O
Renal O
Department O
at O

is O
being O
considered O
for O
the O

3. O
Tendonitis, O
right O

After O
the O
patient's O
informed O
consent O
was O
obtained, O
the O

was O
prepared O
in O
the O
usual O
sterile O
fashion, O
and O
1% O
lidocaine O
along O
with O
0.2 O
cc O
of O
Depo-Medrol O
was O
injected O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
flexor O
POLLICIS O
longus O
tendon O
sheath. O
The O
patient O
tolerated O
the O
procedure O
well. O
4. O
Anemia. O
This O
is O
obviously O
due O
to O
the O
patient's O
chronic O
renal O
disease. O
She O
has O
been O
receiving O
darbepoetin O
injections, O
initially O
weekly, O
then O
every O
other O
week, O
and O
now O
every O
three O
weeks. O
We O
will O
check O
CBC O
today. O
5. O
Right O
shoulder O
pain. O
The O
patient O
cannot O
take O
nonsteroidals O
due O
to O
her O
renal O
problem, O
so O
I O
have O
given O
her O
a O
prescription O
for O
Tylenol O
with O
Codeine, O
of O
which O
she O
may O
take O
one O
or O
one-half O
tablet O
as O
needed O
to O
control O
the O
pain. O
6. O
Regular O
healthcare O
maintenance. O
The O
patient O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
in O
about O
two O

CHIEF O
COMPLAINT: O
A O
65-year-old O
female O
with O
difficulty O
breathing. O
HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
The O
patient O
with O
known O
multiple O
medical O
problems O
presents O
with O
difficulty O
breathing. O
At O
her O
rehabilitation O
facility O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
hypoxic O
and O
thus O
was O
sent O
here. O
The O
patient's O
recent O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
remarkable O
for O
a O
fall O
with O
cervical O
fractures, O
rib O
fractures, O
and O
subsequent O
hemothorax O
for O
which O
she O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Educare-Pullman O
ICU O
over O
the O
end O
of O
December O
through O
the O
beginning O
of O
January. O
The O
patient's O
chest O
tube O
was O
withdrawn O
approximately O
10 O
days O
ago O
and O
the O
patient O
has O
been O
doing O
well O
at O
rehab O
since. O
However, O
today O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
desaturations O
to O
80% O
on O
room O
air. O
She O
had O
shortness O
of O
breath O
as O
well. O
Her O
oxygen O
saturations O
improved O
marginally O
on O
oxygenation O
and O
have O
been O
responsive O
to O
nonrebreather O
treatment O
in O

EMERGENCY O
DEPARTMENT O
COURSE: O
The O
patient O
was O
initially O
given O
Lasix O
and O
nitro B-MEDICATION
with O
improvement O
in O
her O
blood O
pressure O
and O
was O
also O
started O
on O
CPAP. O
She O
seemed O
to O
be O
improving O
clinically O
for O
some O
period O
of O
time O
but O
then O
began O
to O
decline O
in O
her O
mental O
status. O
At O
that O
time O
an O
ABG O
was O
sent O
demonstrating O
hypoxia. O
Prior O
to O
those O
results, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
that O
the O
patient O
likely O
needed O
intubation. O
We O
had O
hope O
to O
hold O
off O
to O
do O
a O
thoracentesis; O
however, O
the O
patient's O
clinical O
course O
declines O
such O
that O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
for O
her O
to O
sit O
up O
for O
the O
procedure. O
On O
CPAP, O
the O
patient's O
oxygen O
saturations O
were O
stable O
throughout O
in O
the O
90s, O
but O
she O
developed O
increasing O
respiratory O
distress. O
Intubation O
was O
complicated O
by O
her O
inability O
to O
flex O
her O
neck, O
her O
large O
tongue, O
and O
her O
body O
habitus; O
was O
successful O
in O
two O
attempts O
with O
one O
episode O
of O
bag O
mask O
ventilation O
in O
between O
those O
attempts. O
For O
full O
details O
of O
the O
procedure, O
please O
see O
the O
attached O
procedure O
note. O
Thoracic O
Surgery O
was O
consulted. O
They O
arrived O
as O
the O
patient O
was O
being O
intubated. O
At O
this O
time O
their O
recommendation O
is O
for O
a O
CT O
scan O
of O
the O
chest O
to O
determine O
whether O
this O
is O
more O
likely O
a O
hemothorax O
or O
a O
pleural O
effusion O
and O
whether O
it O
is O
loculated. O
This O
study O
will O
be O
performed O
and O
then O
patient O
will O
be O
admitted O
to O
her O
ready O
bed O
in O
the O
ICU. O
A O
bedside O

was O
also O
performed O
by O

and O
has O
no O

except O
ongoing O
left O
lower O
extremity O

in O
the O
foot O
only, O
which O
is O
unchanged O
times O
many O
years. O
He O
has O
otherwise O
been O
feeling O
relatively O
well. O
He O
continues O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
Dr. O
Aguilera O
who O
prefers O
to O
take O
a O
conservative O
approach O
given O
the O
difficulty O
of O
performing O
a O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy O
and O
low O
levels O
of O

Review O

is O

Impression: O
Mr. O
Lockwood O
chronic O
kidney O
disease O
appears O
to O
be O
stable, O
as O
I O
have O
mentioned O
before, O
he O
most O
likely O
has O
some O
underlying O
diabetic B-DIABETES
and/or O
hypertensive O
nephropathy, O
but O
I O
continue O
to O
wonder O
whether O
the O
IgA O
paraprotein O
is O
playing O
a O
role O
in O
the O
increasing O
proteinuria O
and O
mild O
CKD. O
Chemotherapy O
would O
be O
indicated O
if O
that O
were O
the O
case.. O
He O
is O
being O
followed O
conservatively O
by O
Dr. O
Aguilera O
thus O
far O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
defniitive O
data. O
I O
have O
ordered O
skull O
and O
hip O
films O
today O
to O
look O
for O
evidence O
of O
myeloma-related O
bone O
disease, O
which O
if O
present O
could O
distinguish O
more O
significant O
disease O
from O
MGUS. O
I O
agree O
with O
Dr. O
Altman O
that O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
definitive O
data,as O
long O
as O
creatinine O
is O
improving O
and O
urinary O
protein O
levels O
remain O
stable O
the O
current O
approach O
is O
reasonable. O
However, O
we O
should O
have O
a O
low O
threshold O
for O
pushing O
Mr. O
Lockwood O
to O
having O
either O
a O
renal O
or O
more O
preferably O
bone O
marrow O
biopsy. O
In O
the O
meantime O
because O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
protein O
and O
albumin O
in O
his O
urine, O
I O
have O
initiated O
dual O
angiotensin O
blockade O
and O
have O
added O
Cozaar B-MEDICATION
25 O
mg O
a O
day O
to O
his O
regimen. O
He O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
in O
four O
months O
and O
will O
have O
labs O
next O
week O
at O
the O
SCH. O
Thank O
you O
for O
referring O
this O
patient. O
Sincerely, O

an O
approximately O
2 O

history O
of O
progressive O
dysphagia, O
solid O
and O

About O
that O
time O
she O
was O
prescribed O
Amoxicillin O
and O
Metronidazole, O
presumably O
for O
H. O

(not O

she O
reports O
an O
adverse O
reaction O
to O
amoxicillin O
with O
rash O
and O

The O
meds O
were O
discontinued O
and O
she O
started O
a O
course O
of O
oral O
methylprednisolone. O
She O
stopped O
this O
several O
weeks O

because O
it O
made O
her O
jittery. O
Approximately O
the O

time O
she O
began O
to O
notice O
that O
food O

would O
feel O
stuck O
in O
the O

on O
further O

she O
also O
may O

noted O
the O

The O

raises O
suspicion O
for O
esophageal O

though O
she O
does O
not O

The O
presence O
of O

is O
likely O
attributable O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
abruptly O

she O
is O

Finally, O
there O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
Mr. O
Ishida O
is O
a O
78 O
y/o, O
who O
p/w O
dizziness O
that O
began O
2 O
to O
3 O
weeks O
ago. O
The O
pt O
says O
the O
dizziness O
was O
worsened O
when O
he O
stood O
up O
to O
walk O
around; O
noting O
that O
it O
was O
particularly O
bad O
when O
he O
was O
standing O
and O
concentrating O
on O
a O
particular O
task O
such O
as O
shaving. O
The O
dizziness O
was O
alleviated O
by O
him O
lying O
down. O
He O
added O
that O
he O
began O
feeling O
dizzy O
during O
the O
storm O
last O
week O
when O
his O
drinking O
water O
was O
contaminated. O
He O
drank O
tap O
water O
until O
he O
was O
told O
it O
was O
undrinkable, O
then O
he O
stopped. O
He O
later O
developed O
diarrhea O
while O
not O
drinking O
any O
water O
and O
only O
having O
occasional O
Coca-cola O
beverages. O
During O
these O
2 O
weeks O
of O
dizziness, O
Mr. O
Ishida O
notes O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
lost O
3-4 O
days O
of O
his O
life, O
saying O
that O
he O
was O
either O
knocked O
out O
or O
unconscious. O
He O
came O
to O
this O
conclusion O
b/c O
his O
medication O
box O
was O
still O
full O
for O
the O
previous O
3 O
days; O
supporting O
his O
reflection O
by O
saying O
he O
rarely O
ever O
misses O
his O
medication. O
Mr. O
Ishida O
states O
that O
the O
room O
was O
not O
spinning O
and O
said O
that O
his O
dizziness O
was O
more O
like O
&#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; O
He O
feels O
that O
his O
problems O
began O
when O
taking O
Tylenol- O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
cannot O
identify O
any O
other O
medication O
that O
is O
associated O
with O
his O
symptoms. O
Mr. O
Ishida O
says O
he&#8217;s O
never O
experienced O
any O
dizziness O
before, O
and O
hoped O
his O
symptoms O
would O
subside O
if O
he O
just O
stayed O
in O
bed. O
Mr. O
Ishida O
also O
described O
an O
increased O
pressure O
in O
his O
head, O
saying, O
&#8220;it O
felt O
as O
if O
my O
eyes O
and O
ears O
were O
going O
to O
explode.&#8221; O

ASSESSMENT O
Mr. O
Ishida O
is O
a O
78 O
y/o O
M O
with O
h/o O
CKD, O
HTN, O
and O
NIDDM B-DIABETES
p/w O
sustained O
dizziness O
and O
altered O
mental O
status. O
Mr. O
Ishida O
is O
most O
likely O
currently O
in O
a O
volume O
depleted O
stated. O
He O
had O
diarrhea O
induced O
by O
the O
contaminated O
water O
from O
the O
storm O
and O
only O
maintained O
his O
hydration O
with O
a O
meager O
2 O
or O
3 O
bottles O
of O
Coca-cola O
over O
several O
days. O
This O
in O
combination O
with O
his O
output O
of O
fluid O
from O
diarrhea, O
his O
diuretic O
medication, O
and O
possible O
osmotic O
diuresis O
(increased O
serum O
glucose O
level O
from O
soda O
intake O
in O
a O
diabetic) O
could O
have O
shifted O
him O
into O
hypovolemia. O
Thus O
Mr. O
Ishida O
might O
have O
decrease O
effective O
arterial O
volume O
causing O
his O
BUN/Cr O
ratio O
to O
be O
elevated, O
indicating O
a O
prerenal O
process. O
Although O
BUN/Cr O
ratio O
is O
not O
&gt;20, O
we O
can O
still O
assume O
that O
he O
has O
prerenal O
ARF O
considering O
his O
use O
of O
diuretics O
and O
h/o O
CKD O
which O
can O
decrease O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
BUN/Cr O
rations O
and O
FENa O
for O
assessing O
etiologies O
of O
renal O
failure. O
Mr. O
Ishida O
additionally O
uses O
NSAIDs O
(e.g. O
Naproxen), O
an O
ARB B-MEDICATION
and O
an O
ACEI, B-MEDICATION
all O
of O
which O
are O
associated O
with O
decreased O
intraglomerular O
pressure O
and O
renal O
vasoconstriction O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
prerenal O
ARF. O
Intrinsic O
ARF O
is O
less O
likely O
considering O
he O
is O
not O
using O
any O
overtly O
nephrotoxic O
drugs O
(e.g. O
amphotericin, O
cisplatin, O
or O
aminoglycosides. O
Conversely, O
he O
is O
at O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
cholesterol O
emboli O
given O
his O
h/o B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
of I-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
hypercholesterolemia B-HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
vasculopathy. O
Lastly, O
Mr. O
Ishida O
my O
have O
a O
postrenal O
ARF O
etiology O
considering O
his O
h/o O
BPH O
which O
could O
lead O
to O
obstruction O
of O
the O
outflow O
tract O
leading O
to O
increased O
pressures O
in O
the O
ureters O
flowing O
back O
up O
into O
the O
kidneys. O
Mr. O
Ishida&#8217;s O
dizziness O
and O
altered O
mental O
status O
are O
both O
explained O
by O
ARF. O
Additional O
explanations O
of O
altered O
mental O
status O
are O
ruled O
out O
via O
the O
history O
and O
physical O
including O
intoxication, O
brain O
hemorrhagic, O
brain O

HISTORY B-SMOKER
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
She O
is O
a O
47-year-old O
woman O
with O
chronic O
hydradenitis O
suppurativa O
since O
the O
age O
of O
18 O
in O
her O
left O
axilla O
and O
her O
groin. O
She O
has O
been O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
multiple O
times O
for O
purulent O
drainage O
around O
her O
groin. O
She O
has O
been O
given O
multiple O
courses O
of O
antibiotics O
including O
Keflex O
and O
dicloxacillin. O
She O
is O
planning O
to O
have O
her O
disease O
surgically O
managed O
in O
the O
next O
few O
months. O
She O
most O
recently O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
on O
January O
7, O
2079 O
with O
swelling O
and O
drainage O
of O
her O
hydradenitis O
in O
her O
groin. O
She O
was O
given O
a O
prescription O
of O
Keflex. O
Shortly O
after O
taking O
the O
first O
tablet, O
she O
developed O
itching O
in O
the O
hands, O
face, O
and O
legs O
and O
as O
well O
as O
hives. O
She O
denied O
any O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
difficulty O
breathing O
or O
loss O
of O
consciousness. O
She O
called O
the O
emergency O
room O
and O
was O
instructed O
to O
stop O
taking O
Keflex O
as O
this O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
allergic O
reaction. O
So O
now, O
she O
is O
here O
for O
follow O
up O
from O
that. O
She O
said O
shortly O
after O
stopping O
antibiotic O
her O
symptoms O
of O
hives O
and O
itchiness O
have O
improved O
very O
quickly. O
She O
is O
still O
complaining O
of O
purulent O
drainage O
around O
her O
groin. O
PAST O
MEDICAL O
HISTORY: O
Diabetes. B-DIABETES
MEDICATIONS: O
Glucotrol, B-MEDICATION
Percocet O
as O
needed O
for O
pain. O
ALLERGIES: O
She O
is O
allergic O
to O
erythromycin O
and O
now O
Keflex. O
She O
gets O
hives O
from O
both. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
Her O
left O
axilla O
looks O
dry. O
Her O
bilateral O
groins O
looks O
red, O
swollen O
tender O
with O
some O
serous O
as O
well O
as O
some O
purulent O
drainage. O
There O
is O
no O
fluctuance O
that O
I O
could O
feel. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
Worsening O
of O
her O
hydradenitis. O
Given O
the O
recent O
allergy O
to O
Keflex, O
we O
will O
obviously O
need O
to O
take O
a O
different O
antibiotic. O
She O
has O
been O
on O
dicloxacillin O
in O
the O
past O
with O
good O
result. O
Despite O
the O
15% O
cross O
allergy O
of O
dicloxacillin O
compared O
to O
Keflex, O
I O
think O
dicloxacillin O
is O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
now. O
If O
this O
does O
not O
work, O
I O
think O
one O
should O
consider O
clindamycin O
for O
treatment. O
I O
will O
go O
ahead O
and O
give O
her O
14 O
days O
worth O
of O
dicloxacillin O
and O
I O
instructing O
her O
to O
notify O
M.D. O
if O
she O
develops O
any O
allergic O
reaction O
to O
this O
medicine. O
I O
also O
gave O
her O
60 O
tablets O
of O
Percocet O
as O
well O
as O
renewed O
her O
renewed O
her O

55-year-old O
gentleman O
in O
the O
office O
today O
for O
evaluation O
of O
lymphedema O
and O
chronic O
venous O
stasis O
in O
both O
lower O
extremities. O
The O
patient O
has O
had O
innumerable O
episodes O
of O
ulceration, O
which O
heal O
with O
TubiGrip O
and O
Profore O
dressings O
ultimately O
to O
break O
down O
again. O
The O
patient O
has O
been O
discharged O
from O
the O
TNA O
and O
as O
I O
understand O
it O
the O
question O
is O
put O
to O
me O
today O
is O
whether O
the O
patient O
is O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O
Lymphapress. O
The O
patient O
has O
had O
chronic O
bilateral O
lower O
extremity O
discoloration O
and O
swelling O
for O
over O
ten O
years. O
He O
has O
never O
worn O
compression O
stockings. O
He O
has O
had O
multiple O
episodes O
of O
recurrent O
ulcers. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
his O
knowledge O
he O
has O
never O
had O
phlebitis O
but O
has O
had O
Unna O
boots O
in O
the O
past. O
The O
patient O
denies O
any O
prolonged O
hospitalization, O
long O
bone O
fractures O
or O
prior O
history O
of O
DVT. O
There O
is O
no O
family O
history O
of O
varicose O
veins O
or O
DVT. O
He O
has O
no O
personal O
history O
of O
cancer O
or O
trauma. O
He O
has O
not O
been O
involved O
in O
any O
prolonged O
travel, O
does O
not O
take O
any O
hormone O
medication O
and O
is O
unemployed. O
The O
patient's O

is O
notable O
for O

On O
physical O
exam O
he O
is O
a O
morbidly B-OBESE
obese I-OBESE
gentleman O
with O
intertriginous O
rashes O
question O
fungal O
origin O
in O
the O
axilla O
on O
the O
right. O
He O
has O
distant O
breath O
sounds O
with O
fine O
expiratory O
wheezes. O
He O
has O
some O
tenderness O
in O
the O
right O
upper O
quadrant O
to O
palpation. O
He O
has O
a O
huge O
protuberant O
abdomen. O
There O
is O
no O
tenderness O
in O
the O
right O
upper O
quadrant. O
He O
has O
bounding O
carotid, O
brachial O
and O
radial O
pulses. O
His O
femoral O
pulses O
are O
not O
palpable O
likely O
due O
to O
his O
body O
habitus. O
On O
the O
left O
his O
dorsalis O
pedis O
is O
1+ O
and O
on O
the O
right O
his O
posterior O
tibial O
was O
2+. O
He O
has O
huge O
legs O
with O
evidence O
of O
stasis O
dermatitis O
and O
lipodermatosclerosis, O
which O
is O
greater O
on O
the O
left O
than O
the O
right. O
He O
has O
prominent O
varices O
on O
his O
right O
thigh O
near O
the O
takeoff O
of O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
anterolateral O
accessory O
branch. O
He O
has O
severe O
brawny O
induration, O
discoloration O
and O
superficial O
ulcers O
on O
the O
right O
with O
none O
on O
the O
left. O
The O
patient O
seems O
somewhat O
reserved O
but O
is O
quite O
communicative O
when O
prompted. O
The O
results O
of O
his O
noninvasive O
vascular O
lab O
studies O
showed O
bilateral O
greater O
saphenous O
vein O
reflux. O
The O
reflux O
is O
confined O
to O
the O
first O
accessory O
saphenous O
vein O
in O
the O
right O
leg O
and O
the O
saphenopopliteal O
junction O
in O
the O
proximal O
thigh. O
It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
reflux O
in O
the O
saphenopopliteal O
junction O
on O
the O
right O
is O
0, O
in O
the O
anterolateral O
saphenous O
vein O
on O
the O
right O
it O
is O
3 O
seconds O
and O
in O
the O
small O
saphenous O
vein O
on O
the O
right O
the O
reflux O
is O
3 O
seconds. O
In O
the O
deep O
femoral O
vein, O
common O
femoral O
and O
superficial O
femoral O
vein O
there O
is O
no O
reflux. O
In O
contrast O
on O
the O
left O
there O
is O
reflux O
at O
the O
saphenopopliteal O
junction O
of O
a O
mere O
3 O
seconds, O
in O
the O
proximal O
greater O
saphenous O
vein O
3 O
seconds, O
midthigh O
3 O
seconds O
and O
distal O
thigh O
3 O
seconds. O
In O
the O
popliteal O
vein O
there O
is O
no O
reflux O
and O
the O
small O
saphenous O
vein O
there O
is O
3 O
seconds. O
Due O
to O
the O
patient's O
size O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
identify O
perforators. O
In O
summary, O
we O
have O
a O
morbidly O
obese O
gentleman O
with O
mild O
to O
moderate O
reflux O
on O
examination O
and O
severe O
stasis O
dermatitis O
and O
discoloration. O
Thus O
there O
is O
a O
mismatch O
between O
the O
degree O
of O
physical O
findings O
and O
objective O
laboratory O
data. O
I O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
the O
case O
primarily O
because O
the O
patient O
cannot O
lie O
flat O
and O
often O
sleeps O
with O
his O
legs O
in O
a O
dependent O
position. O
Thus O
he O
has O
an O
ongoing O
stasis O
in O
his O
legs O
due O
to O
inactivity O
and O
dependency. O
This O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
morbid O
obesity, O
that O
is O
a O
girth O
of O
385 O
pounds O
that O
presses O
on O
his O
abdomen O
24 O
hours O
a O
day, O
seven O
days O
a O
week O
and O
compresses O
the O
vena O
cava O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lymphatic O
drainage O
of O
his O
legs. O
All O
of O
these O
factors O
taken O
into O
account O
contribute O
to O
his O
discoloration, O
ulceration O
and O
lower O
extremity O
swelling. O
The O
solution O
to O
this O
problem O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
one. O
With O
his O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea O
and O
abdominal O
girth O
the O
chances O
of O
him O
objectively O
putting O
his O
legs O
up O
so O
they O
are O
higher O
than O
his O
belly O
or O
heart O
are O
nonexistent. O
Certainly O
it O
is O
not O
unreasonable O
to O
use O
a O
Lymphapress O
machine O
to O
help O
remove O
some O
of O
the O
swelling O
and O
edema O
that O
this O
patient O
experiences O
in O
his O
legs, O
however O
a O
Lymphapress O
is O
not O
a O
maintenance O
device O
but O
is O
an O
interventional O
device. O
If O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
plan O
as O
to O
what O
to O
put O
on O
his O
legs O
after O
the O
Lymphapress O
is O
removed O
in O
between O
treatments O
it O
will O
be O
of O
no O
long-term O
benefit. O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
he O
use O
a O
Lymphapress O
machine O
and O
intermittent O
wraps O
with O
6 O
to O
8 O
inch O
ACE O
wraps. O
I O
would O
always O
make O
the O
tension O
in O
the O
ACE O
wraps O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
ankle O
and O
heel O
greater O
than O
the O
midcalf. O
I O
have O
given O
him O
a O
prescription O
for O
a O
Lymphapress O
machine O
as O
well O
as O
ACE O
wraps O
and O
discussed O
the O
relevant O
components O
of O
his O
care, O
which O
are O
important. O
I O
hope O
that O
these O
interventions O
will O
help O
him O
with O
his O
lower O
extremity O
edema O
and O
swelling. O
It O
is O
unlikely O
that O
any O
intervention O
at O
the O
level O
of O
his O
veins O
will O
overcome O
the O
terrible O
hydrostatic O
pressure O
of O
his O
abdomen O
and O
total O
body O
girth. O
If O
I O
can O
provide O
any O
additional O
information O

Impression: O
Mr. O
Rivers O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
47-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
multiple O
cardiac O
risk O
factors, O
notably O
insulin-dependent O
diabetes O
mellitus O
as O
well O
as O
poorly O
controlled O
hypertension O
with O
no O
known O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
now O
presenting O
for O
cardiovascular O
clearance O
prior O
to O
elective O
hip O
repair O
scheduled O
for O
three O
days O
from O
now. O
This O
gentleman O
has O
no O
known O
coronary O
disease O
and O
has O
a O
reasonable O
exercise O
capacity, O
which O
I O
estimate O
to O
be O
3 O
to O
5 O
METS. O
Most O
recently, O
given O
his O
hip O
and O
orthopedic O
issues, O
he O
has O
been O
unable O
to O
ambulate O
even O
to O
three O
METS. O
However, O
prior O
to O
his O
orthopedic O
injury O
several O
months O
ago, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
ambulate O
up O
two O
flights O
of O
steps O
with O
only O
minimal O
dyspnea O
upon O
reaching O
the O
top O
step O
and O
without O
any O
exertional O
chest O
discomfort. O
However, O
given O
his O
multiple O
risk O
factors, O
notably O
his O
poorly O
controlled O
diabetes O
and O
poorly O
controlled O
hypertension O
as O
well O
as O
former O
tobacco O
use, O
he O
certainly O
is O
at O
very O
high O
risk O
for O
obstructive O
coronary O
disease. O
As O
such, O
I O
recommended O
we O
obtain O
a O
Persantine O
PET O
stress O
test O
for O
tomorrow O
morning. O
If O
this O
test O
is O
normal O
without O
any O
high O
risk O
features O
or O
without O
any O
evidence O
for O
obstructive O
coronary O
disease, O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
for O
him O
to O
proceed O
with O
surgery O
later O
on O
this O
week. O
This O
test O
will O
also O
suffice O
for O
his O
upcoming O
gastric O
laparoscopic O
bypass O
surgery, O
which O
is O
scheduled O
for O
01/2074. O
With O
regards O
to O
his O
medication, O
his O
blood O
pressure O
still O
is O
not O
at O
goal O
below O
130. O
As O
such, O
I O
have O
increased O
his O
Toprol-XL O
from O
125 O
mg O
to O
200 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily. O
This O
medication O
should O
be O
continued O
through O
all O
surgery. O
Additionally, O
if O
this O
is O
not O
sufficient O
in O
bringing O
his O
blood O
pressure O
down O
below O
130, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
diuretic O
to O
his O
regimen O
either O
Lasix O
20 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily O
or O
hydrochlorothiazide O
25 O
mg O
p.o. O
daily. O
Additionally, O
it O
will O
be O
essential O
that O
his O
diabetes O
be O
taken O
better O
control O
of O
and O
he O
is O
now O
working O
closely O
with O
the O
diabetes O
center O
here O
at O
the O
KCM O
to O
do O
so. O
His B-DIABETES
last B-DIABETES
A1c B-DIABETES
was I-DIABETES
approximately I-DIABETES
13 I-DIABETES
and O
this O
is O
certainly O
way O
out O
of O
range O
for O
someone O
of O
his O
young O
age. O
I O
am O
hopeful O
with O
continued O
medical O
therapy O
this O
gentleman O
can O
continue O
to O
improve O
his O
life O
and O
undergo O
orthopedic O
surgery O
as O
well O
as O
gastric O
bypass O
surgery O
with O
significant O
improvement O
to O
his O
quality O
of O
life O
and O
future O
cardiac O
risk. O
With O
regards O
to O
his O
hypertension, O
he O
is O
on O
multiple O
agents O
including O
Toprol-XL, O
Aldactone, O
Avapro O
and O
minoxidil. O
Given O
the O
multitude O
of O
agents, O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
screen O
this O
gentleman O
for O
secondary O
causes O
of O
hypertension O
including O
hyperthyroidism O
as O
well O
as O
hyperaldosteronism, O
but O
notably O
he O
has O
currently O
started O
the O
Aldactone O
and O
this O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
do O
while O
on O
the O
medication. O
We O
could O
consider O
in O
the O
future, O
if O
his O
blood O
pressure O
is O
not O
well O
controlled O
either O
washing O
out O
the O
Aldactone O
and O
then O
followed O
by O
renin O
and O
aldosterone O
testing O
versus O
BLANK O
sampling O
in O
the O
future O
if O
deemed O
necessary. O
Additionally, O
if O
he O
is O
found O
to O
have O
coronary O
artery O
disease, O
one O
other O
option O
despite O
his O
lack O
of O
claudication O
would O
be O
evaluation O
of O
renal O
artery O
stenosis. O
As O
mentioned, O
I O
will O
obtain O
the O
stress O
imaging O
tomorrow O
morning O
and O
then O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
have O
a O
better O
assessment O
of O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
proceed O
with O
surgery O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
I O
will O
follow O
back O
with O
him O
in O
approximately O
several O
months' O
time O
for O
followup O
of O
his O
general O
cardiovascular O
care. O
Please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O
if O
there O
is O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
to O
contribute O
to O
his O
ongoing O
medical O
care O
in O
the O
interim. O
He O
has O
been O
provided O
both O
my O
e-mail O
and O
pager O
number O
to O
contact O
me O
if O
there O
is O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
to O
assist O
in O
his O
care O
going O
forward. O
Thank O
you. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Pagan: O
Your O
patient O
Lauren O
Ferrara O
came O
into O
the O
office O
today O
for O
a O
follow-up O
visit. O
As O
you O
know, O
she O
has O
a O
long O
and O
complex O
history O
of O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
with O
bilateral O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafts. O
Her O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
had O
occluded O
once O
previously, O
but O
was O
successfully O
restored O
by O
Dr. O
Tejeda. O
In O
02/61, O
we O
had O
detected O
a O
high-grade O
stenosis O
in O
the O
distal O
aspect O
of O
this O
graft O
by O
surveillance, O
and O
she O
underwent O
revision O
with O
a O
local O
patch O
angioplasty. O
A O
subsequent O
ultrasound O
study O
done O
in O
04/61 O
showed O
a O
widely O
patent O
graft O
and O
she O
has O
remained O
entirely O
asymptomatic. O
She O
is O
not O
particularly O
active. O
She O
denies O
any O
rest O
pain O
in O
the O
feet O
or O
significant O
claudication O
symptoms. O
Recently, O
however, O
her O
husband O
had O
noticed O
some O
cyanosis O
of O
her O
left O
toes. O
She O
remains O
on O
low O
dose O
aspirin B-MEDICATION
in O
addition O
to O
Lipitor B-MEDICATION
and O
her O
other O
medications. O
She O
is O
a O
nonsmoker. B-SMOKER
On O
examination O
today, O
she O
appeared O
well O
and O
in O
good O
spirits. O
Blood O
pressure O
was O
measured O
at O
130/60 O
in O
the O
right O
arm. O
Lower O
extremity O
pulses O
are O
2+ O
at O
the O
femoral O
level O
bilaterally. O
On O
the O
right, O
there O
is O
a O
strong, O
easily O
appreciated O
pulse O
over O
her O
popliteal O
to O
dorsalis O
pedis O
bypass O
graft, O
and O
the O
foot O
is O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused. O
On O
the O
left, O
I O
could O
not O
appreciate O
a O
pulse O
over O
her O
bypass O
graft O
incisions. O
The O
left O
foot O
is O
slightly O
cooler O
than O
the O
right, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
mild O
cyanotic O
changes O
on O
the O
first O
toe O
in O
particular. O
There O
are O
no O
frank O
or O
impending O
ulcerations O
or O
areas O
of O
irreversible O
ischemia. O
There O
is O
a O
strong O
Doppler O
signal O
obtained O
over O
the O
posterior O
tibial O
artery O
at O
the O
ankle O
with O
an O
occlusion O
pressure O
of O
approximately O
100 O
mmHg. O
This O
yields O
an O
ankle O
index O
of O
nearly O
0.7 O
and O
maybe O
falsely O
elevated. O
A O
follow-up O
ultrasound O
study O
was O
performed O
in O
the O
vascular O
laboratory O
today. O
The O
right O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
remains O
widely O
patent. O
As O
suspected, O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
has O
now O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
occluded. O
Ms. O
Ferrara O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
has O
occluded O
sometime O
during O
the O
last O
several O
months O
and O
her O
collateralization O
is O
clearly O
more O
marginal. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
she O
does O
not O
have O
any O
clear-cut O
symptoms O
of O
critical O
limb O
ischemia, O
though O
the O
slight O
discoloration O
of O
her O
toes O
is O
a O
clear O
sign. O
The O
previous O
history O
of O
this O
graft O
including O
a O
prior O
thrombosis O
requiring O
thrombectomy O
and O
multiple O
revisions O
would O
not O
board O
well O
for O
any O
attempted O
thrombolysis O
or O
repeated O
rescue O
of O
this O
particular O
conduit. O
Conversely, O
she O
has O
already O
had O
all O
of O
her O
lower O
extremity O
veins O
used O
for O
bypass O
operations O
and O
any O
redo O
bypass O
would O
be O
technically O
complicated. O
I O
will O
need O
to O
review O
her O
previous O
angiograms O
from O
earlier O
this O
year O
to O
determine O
the O
status O
of O
her O
runoff O
and O
what O
the O
alternatives O
might O
be. O
At O
the O
present O
time, O
however, O
she O
appears O
to O
have O
marginal, O
though O
reasonable O
collateralization O
and O
is O
essentially O
asymptomatic. O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
increase O
her O
antithrombotic O
therapy O
and O
I O
added O
a O
daily O
dose O
of O
Plavix O
to O
supplement O
a O
baby B-MEDICATION
aspirin. I-MEDICATION
I O
spent O
sometime O
discussing O
the O
signs O
of O
worsening O
ischemia O
including O
more O
diffuse O
cyanotic O
skin O
changes O
of O
the O
toes, O
rest O
pain, O
or O
ulceration. O
At O
a O
minimum, O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
in O
two O
months O
for O
reexamination, O
but O
I O
strongly O
encouraged O
the O
patient O
and O
her O
husband O
to O
contact O
us O
soon O
if O
there O
are O
any O
symptoms O
that O
suggest O
worsening O
of O
her O
circulation. O
If O
her O
collateralization O
can O
remain O
stable, O
it O
certainly O
would O
be O
preferable O
to O
avoid O
having O
to O
consider O
a O
complex O
redo O
bypass O
with O
very O
limited O
remaining O
vein O
in O
this O
patient. O
Thank O
you O
again O
for O
allowing O
us O
to O
participate O
in O
her O
care. O
Please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O
if O
I O
can O
be O
of O
further O
assistance. O
Sincerely, O

HISTORY B-SMOKER
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Ms. O
Ferrara O
returns O
for O
followup O
visit. O
She O
is O
now O
approximately O
one O
month O
out O
from O
a O
redo O
left O
popliteal O
to O
peroneal O
artery O
bypass O
graft O
using O
a O
basilic O
vein O
from O
right O
arm. O
Postoperatively, O
she O
did O
well, O
although O
she O
was O
very O
sensitive O
to O
pain O
medication O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
get O
her O
moving. O
She O
complains O
of O
persistent O
weakness O
and O
numbness O
in O
her O
right O
hand O
and O
some O
pain O
shooting O
into O
her O
right O
forearm. O
According O
to O
the O
patient, O
this O
was O
present O
early O
during O
her O
hospitalization, O
but O
because O
of O
other O
issues, O
it O
was O
not O
paid O
very O
much O
attention. O
She O
denies O
any O
significant O
pain O
in O
the O
leg. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
examination O
today, O
she O
appears O
generally O
well. O
The O
right O
arm O
harvest O
site O
is O
healed O
well O
and O
the O
upper O
arm O
is O
soft O
without O
any O
evidence O
of O
hematoma, O
whatsoever. O
The O
hand O
is O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused O
with O
intact O
distal O
pulses; O
however, O
she O
clearly O
has O
weakness O
of O
flexion O
of O
the O
first O
and O
second O
digits O
and O
some O
weakness O
of O
opposition. O
She O
appears O
to O
have O
intact O
ulnar O
and O
radial O
function. O
The O
lower O
extremity O
incision O
has O
also O
healed O
well O
and O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
Doppler O
signal O
over O
the O
peroneal O
artery O
at O
the O
ankle. O
The O
foot O
is O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused O
and O
the O
previous O
ischemic O
lesion O
on O
the O
big O
toe O
is O
healing. O
She O
had O
a O
followup O
graft O
scan O
today, O
which O
revealed O
her O
bypass O
graft O
to O
be O
patent O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
significant O
narrowing. O
The O
ankle O
index O
was O
measured O
at O
0.88 O
on O
the O
left O
and O
0.64 O
on O
the O
right. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
Ms. O
Ferrara O
lower O
extremity O
circulation O
is O
stable O
and O
her O
bypass O
graft O
is O
functioning O
nicely. O
Unfortunately, O
she O
appears O
to O
have O
had O
some O
neuropathic O
complication O
in O
her O
right O
arm O
that O
may O
have O
been O
related O
to O
her O
vein O
harvest O
surgery. O
The O
exam O
suggests O
some O
possible O
partial O
comprise O
of O
median O
nerve O
function. O
In O
any O
case, O
she O
is O
able O
to O
function O
reasonably O
well O
and O
a O
course O
of O
occupational O
therapy O
may O
improve O
things. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
compression O
from O
hematoma O
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
infection. O
We O
will O
continue O
to O
follow O
her O
closely O
with O
a O
return O
visit O
scheduled O
in O
six O
weeks O
and O
a O
course O
of O
therapy O
was O
prescribed. O

to O
refer O
her O
for O
a O
PET O
CT O
scan. O
Her O
small O
nodules O
in O
her O
lung O
fields O
bilaterally O
are O
all O
sub O
5mm O
and O
may O
not O
be O
related O
to O
this O
malignancy. O
She O
does O
have O
modestly O
enlarged O
hilar O
nodes. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
her O
to O
Thoracic O
Surgery O
for O
consideration O
of O
a O
mediastinoscopy O
and O
potential O
resection. O
She O
would O
likely O
require O
cardiac O
clearance O
before O
this O
would O
occur. O
She O
can O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
after O
her O
surgery O
if O
this O
proves O
to O
be O
an O
inflammatory O
lung O
disorder. O
Otherwise, O
she O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
Oncology. O
If O
she O
was O
deemed O
not O
to O
be O
an O
appropriate O
surgical O
candidate, O
either O
because O
of O
metastatic O
disease O
or O
because O
of O
comorbidity, O
she O
could O
have O
this O
lesion O
biopsied O
via O
a O
transthoracic O
needle O
aspirate. O

HISTORY B-SMOKER
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Mr. O
Qin O
is O
a O
patient O
of O
Dr. O
Potter's, O
who O
is O
in O
today O
for O
urgent O
care. O
He O
is O
complaining O
of O
a O
funny O
sensation O
in O
his O
neck O
and O
occasional O
soreness O
in O
his O
left O
neck. O
Sometimes O
it O
hurts O
worse O
with O
breathing. O
Sometimes O
he O
feels O
a O
little O
catch O
and O
a O
fleeting O
moment O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
Of O
note, O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
last O
week O
for O
these O
symptoms. O
He O
was O
admitted, O
I O
think O
01/15-01/16. O
He O
was O
ruled O
out O
for O
an O
MI O
and O
actually O
had O
a O
stress O
test, O
which O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
ischemia. O
Furthermore, O
he O
was O
monitored O
the O
entire O
time, O
including O
while O
he O
was O
having O
this O
symptom O
of O
a O
funny O
feeling O
in O
his O
chest O
followed O
by O
a O
little O
shortness O
of O
breath O
or O
catching O
his O
breath O
as O
he O
describes O
it O
and O
no O
arrhythmia O
was O
documented O
whatsoever. O
He O
was O
ultimately O
discharged O
from O
the O
hospital O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
Costa O
chondritis. O
He O
is O
describing O
this O
pain O
in O
his O
left O
neck O
and O
he O
wonders O
if O
it O
is O
somehow O
related O
to O
the O
pain O
in O
his O
chest. O
He O
said O
he O
tried O
gargling O
with O
mouthwash O
some O
and O
that O
did O
seem O
to O
help O
a O
little. O
This O
neck O
or O
throat O
pain O
has O
been O
going O
on O
for O
the O
past O
three O
days. O
PAST O
MEDICAL O
HISTORY: O
Remarkable O
for O
osteoarthritis, O
hypertension B-HYPERTENSION
and O
other O
noncontributory O
problems. O
MEDICATIONS: O
Aspirin, B-MEDICATION
atenolol, B-MEDICATION
Lipitor B-MEDICATION
and O
vitamin O
E. O
ALLERGIES: O
None. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
Today, O
he O
is O
alert O
and O
oriented. O
His O
weight O
is O
255.25 O
pounds, O
blood O
pressure O
110/80, O
pulse O
68, O
temperature O
97.4. O
Sinuses: O
Non-tender. O
Nasal O
turbinates: O
Benign. O
Tympanic O
membranes: O
With O
good O
light O
reflex, O
landmarks O
well O
seen. O
Oropharynx: O
Without O
erythema, O
exudate, O
edema. O
Neck: O
Supple, O
without O
adenopathy. O
I O
am O
able O
to O
locate O
the O
spot O
that's O
bothering O
him O
by O
pressing O
on O
the O
mid O
outside O
of O
his O
left O
neck O
near O
where O
his O
carotid O
pulse O
is, O
but O
he O
does O
not O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
discomfort O
with O
this O
pressure O
and O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
quite O
what O
he O
is O
getting O
at. O
Carotids O
are O
2+ O
bilaterally. O
Lungs: O
Clear O
to O
auscultation O
and O
percussion O
throughout. O
Heart: O
Regular, O
without O
murmur, O
rub O
or O
gallop. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
find O
a O
clear O
etiology O
for O
Mr. O
Quevedo O
discomfort, O
although O
I O
think O
he O
is O
probably O
right O
that O
it O
is O
related O
to O
the O
musculoskeletal O
chest O
pain O
that O
he O
is O
having. O
I O
did O
reassure O
him O
and O
tell O
him O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
for O
him O
to O
take O
ibuprofen O
for O
this O
as O
he O
had O
been O
directed O
in O
the O
hospital. O
He O
does O
have O
an O
appointment O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Potter O
in O
follow-up O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
weeks O
and O
he O
will O
call O
or O
return O
if O
any O
new O
symptoms O
develop. O

Unfortunately O
she O
represented O
with O
recurrent O
ataxia O

at O
that O

Rapidly O

I O
don't O
doubt O
that O
this O
is O
most O
likely O
hyperglycemia O
with O

gut O
dysmotility, O
but O
differential O
includes O
small O

I O

that O

small O

is O
still O
a O
possibility. O
Recommendations: O
1) O
Gastroparesis O
may O

in O

due O
to O

we O

were O
normal O
earlier O

this O
does O
not O
exclude O

of O

would O
be O
MR O

I O
do O
not O
think O
this O
is O
warranted O
at O

ischemic O
small O

should O
remain O
on O
the O

4) O
With O
hyperdynamic O
precordium O
and O
tachycardia, O
would O
check O
TSH, O
though O
this O
is O
almost O
certainly O
due O
to O

She O
has O
a O
h/o O
several O
admisions O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
abdominal O
pain O
attributed O
to O
diabetic O
gastroparesis. O
She O
has O
had O
an O
extensive O

in O
the O

including O
multiple O
abdominal O
CT O
scans, O
gastric O

and O

All O
studies O
were O
negative O
except O
for O
the O
gastric O

She O
has O
been O
treated O
with O
multiple O
medications, O
including O
Reglan, O
Ativan, O
Compazine, O
and O
Zelnorm O
without O
much O

She O
is O
currently O
taking O
Neurontin O
and O
Cymbalta O
to O
treat O
neuropathic O
pain, O
and O
her O
PCP O
started O
her O
on O
MS O
Contin O
in O
December O
since O
nothing O
else O
seemed O
to O
be O
helping. O
The O
pt O
states O
that O
the O
MS O
Contin O
helped O
during O
the O
month O
of O
December, O
but O
then O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
working O
as O
well. O
The O
pt O
is O
distraught O
over O
her O
symptoms O
because O
the O
pain O
is O
severe O
and O
frequent. O
She O
has O
been O
unable O
to O
return O
to O
work O
for O
2 O
years O
because O
of O
the O
pain, O
and O
she O
would O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so. O
The O
pain O
is O
not O
necessarily O
related O
to O
eating. O
Yesterday, O
she O
felt O
well O
and O
was O
able O
to O
eat. O
Today, O
she O
was O
doing O
fine O
until O
she O
had O
to O
drink O
the O
gastrografin, O
and O
then O
it O
escalated O
to O
an O
8/10. O
She O
received O
some O
IV O
morphine, O
and O
now O
it O
is O
down O
to O
4/10. O
At O
Missouri O
Baptist O
Hospital, O
her O
MS O
Contin O
was O
held, O
but O
when O
her O
BP O

she O

She O
did O
have O
a O

I O
think O

2. O
HTN: O
BP O
is O
very O
elevated O
today, O
and O
this O
may O
in O
part O
be O
due O
to O
stopping O

year O
old O
woman O
who O
presents O
for O
an O
annual O
exam O
with O
her O
daughter-in-law, O
Franchesca O
Justice. O
They O
would O
like O
to O
discuss O
the O
following O
issues: O
1. O
Shoulder O
pain: O
She O
continues O
to O
have O
bilateral O
shoulder O
pain, O
but O
the O
L O
shoulder O
is O
worse O
than O
the O
right. O
She O
has O
been O
taking O
Prednisone O
9 O
mg O
a O
day O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
has O
not O
f/u O
with O
Rheum O
for O
about O
a O
year. O
She O
did O
have O
a O
cortisone O
in O
the O
L O
shoulder O
in O
the O
past. O
She O
is O
able O
to O
lift O
her O
arms O
over O
her O
head. O
2. O
Depression: O
Her O
family O
feels O
that O
she O
is O
doing O
much O
better O
on O
the O
Effexor O
than O
the O
Celexa. O
The O
pt O
has O
seen O
Dr. O
Ramsey O
in O
Psych O
a O
few O
months O
ago. O
3. O
Dementia: O
Dr. O
Ramsey O
recommended O
continuing O
on O
the O
Aricept. O
Overall, O
the O
pt's O
family O
feels O
that O
her O
memory O
is O
worsening, O
although O
some O
days O
are O
better O
than O
others. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
any O
other O
episodes O
of O
halluncination, O
as O
was O
described O
in O
an O
email O
from O
her O
son O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago. O
The O
pt O
states O
that O
she O
is O
sleeping O
and O
eating O
well, O
but O
her O
family O
thinks O
that O
she O
sleeps O
too O
much. O
4. O
Eyelid O
surgery: O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
have O
surgery O
on O
her O
eyelids O
on O
May O
25. O
The O
drooping O
of O
the O
lids O
is O
so O
bad O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
that O
she O
is O
unable O
to O
read. O
5. O
Incontinence: O
She O
has O
now O
had O
3 O
collagen O
implants O
for O
her O
bladder. O
The O
pt O
does O
not O
think O
that O
she O
is O
any O
better, O
but O
when O
Dr. O
Xuereb O
tested O
her O
a O
few O
months O
ago, O
she O
saw O
some O
improvement. O
6. O
Diarrhea: O
She O
has O
about O
2 O
soft O
BM's O
a O
day, O
but O
she O
also O
has O
intermittent O
diarrhea. O
Her O
daughter-in-law O
is O
wondering O
if O
the O
pt O
might O
be O
lactose O
intolerant. O
She O
is O
not O
having O
any O
blood O
in O
her O
stool. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
any O
diarrhea O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night. O
She O
has O
never O
gotten O
a O
colonoscopy O
since O
the O
last O
attempt O
just O
prior O
to O
her O
hospitalization O
2 O
years O
ago. O

The O
pt O
states O
that O
she O
does O
not O
eat O
much O
sugar, O
but O
her O
daughter-in-law O
thinks O
that O
she O
probably O
does O
consume O
a O
fair O
number O
of O
sweets. O

The O
pt's O
family O
is O
not O
sure O
if O
she O
is O
taking O
her O

every O
day. O
They O
pay O
a O
private O
nurse O
to O
come O
lay O
out O
the O
meds O
in O
the O
am, O
but O
the O
pt O
is O
often O
asleep O
when O
she O

take O
the O

1. O

Discussed O
the O
importance O
of O
regular O

with O

We O
should O
aim O
to O

decreased. O
Will O

today. O
Franchesca O
will O

2. O
Depression: O
She O
seems O
better. O
Continue O
Effexor. O
3. O
Dementia: O
Will O
continue O
Aricept. O
Discussed O
keeping O
pt O
stimulated O
with O
outings, O
family O
visits. O
Her O
excessive O
sleeping O
is O
likely O
a O
combination O
of O
several O
factors, O
including O
her O
multiple O
medications, O
depression, O
and O
possibly O
the O
dementia. O
4. O
Eyelid O
surgery: O
Pre-op O
exam O
today. O
Will O
order O
complete O
metabolic O
panel, O
CBC, O
and O
EKG. O
5. O
Incontinence: O
It O
is O
not O
likely O
that O
she O
will O
be O
able O
to O
have O
any O
more O
procedures O
at O
this O
point. O
Some O
of O
the O
incontinence O
may O
be O
secondary O
to O
dementia O
rather O
than O
pure O
stress O
incontinence. O
6. O
Diarrhea: O
Discussed O
trying O
a O
lactose-free O
diet O
for O
a O
week O
to O
determine O
if O
lactose-intolerance O
may O
be O
playing O
a O
role. O
Will O
set O
up O
a O
virtual O
colonoscopy O
since O
the O
pt O
had O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
with O
the O
sedation O
for O
her O
colonoscopy O
2 O
years O
ago. O
7. O
DM: O
Check O
glucose O
and O
Hgb O
A1C. O
8. O
Hyperlipidemia: O
Check O
fasting O
lipids- O
she O
will O
get O
them O
drawn O
at O
Dameron O
Hospital. O
9. O
Medication O
compliance: O
Discussed O
trying O
to O
get O
nurse O
to O
come O
a O
little O
later O
in O
the O
day O
so O
that O
pt O
could O
be O
observed O
while O
taking O
her O
medication. O
10. O
Onychomycosis: O
I O
do O
not O
think O
oral O
medication O
would O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
for O
this O
patient O
because O
the O
risks O
of O
hepatotoxicity O
outweigh O
the O
benefits. O
Will O
refer O
her O
to O
Podiatry O
for O
care O
of O
the O
toenails O
since O
the O
pt O
has O
a O
h/o O

her O
medication. O
Stress O

fraction O
is O
65% O

As O
part O
of O
her O
workup, O
she O
had O
pulmonary O
function O
tests, O
which O
showed O
moderate O
obstruction O
without O
a O
bronchodilator O
response O
and O
some O
mild O
restriction O
likely O
due O
to O
her O
obesity. B-OBESE
In O
addition, O
she O
was O
quite O
anemic O
with O
hematocrit O
of O
19 O
on O
presentation. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
hemolysis. O
She O
is O
mildly O
iron O
deficient O
and O
colonoscopy O
showed O
a O
tubulovillous O
adenoma, O
which O
was O
excised O
as O
well O
as O
a O
short O
area O
of O
Barrett's O
esophagus. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
active O
bleeding. O
She O
received O
multiple O
transfusions O
throughout O
her O
stay O
and O
was O
started O
on O
darbepoetin, O
for O
what O
was O
ultimately O
felt O
to O
be O
anemia O
of O
renal O
disease. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
Lahey O
Clinic O
and O
has O
just O
returned O
home. O
Her O
son, O
Brendon O
Ambrose O
who O
was O
the O
healthcare O
proxy, O
is O
here O
with O
her O
today. O
Today, O
she O
feels O
reasonably O
well. O
She O
is O
still O
somewhat O
weak O
from O
the O
prolonged O
hospitalization, O
but O
is O
quite O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
lost O
30 O
pounds. O
She O
is O
taking O
her O
medications O
regularly O
and O
remains O
on O
2 O
liters O
of O
oxygen. O
She O
has O
no O
chest O
pain O
or O
shortness O
of O

She O
will O
check O
daily O

I O
will O
speak O
to O
Dr. O
Vandiver, O
her O
cardiologist O
whom O
she O
is O
seeing O
next O
week O
about O
getting O
her O
enrolled O
in O
the O

she O

We O
will O

she O

4. O
Chronic O
renal O
insufficiency. O
Creatinine O
at O
baseline O
of O
3.2. O
She O
will O
need O
to O
be O
watched O
closely. O
She O
expressed O
interest O
in O
possibility O
of O
her O
renal O
transplant O
should O
that O
become O
necessary. O
There O
has O
been O
a O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
she O
has O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
based O
on O
a O
Doppler O
ultrasound O
done O
during O
rehabilitation. O
I O
think O
this O
must O
have O
been O
done O
at O
Brookwood O
Hospital O
because O
no O
studies O
are O
available O
in O
the O
HH O
system. O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
had O
done O
MRA O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago, O
which O
showed O
no O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
at O
that O
time, O
but O
her O
worsening O
renal O
function O
is O
new. O
She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
next O
week O
and O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
her O
expressly O
raising O
this O
issue. O
Her O
son O
brought O
up O
the O
issue O
of O
perhaps O
consolidating O
all O
her O
care O
at O
the O
HH O
,in O
particular O
is O
seeing O
a O
nephrologist O
here. O
She O
is O
quite O
fond O
of O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
who O
has O
cared O
for O
her O
for O
years, O
but O
I O
think O
given O
the O
complexity O
of O
medical O
care. O
this O
might O
not O
be O
a O
bad O
idea. O
She O
is O
going O
to O
discuss O
with O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
and O
I O
will O
E-mail O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
as O
well. O

this. O

Heme. O
Her O
anemia O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
iron O

and O
anemia O
of O
renal O

She O
needed O
several O
transfusions O
during O
the O

She O
is O
scheduled O
to O
see O
Hematology O
at O
Stone-Wheeling O
in O
January. O
In O
the O

I O
have O
spoken O
to O
Dr. O
Dougherty O
who O
agrees O
to O
monitor O
her O
in O
the O
Renal O
Department O
at O
St. O

If O
necessary, O
they O
can O
give O
her O
intravenous O
iron. O
I O
will O
check O

HPI: O
Patient O
presented O
initially O
10/20/69 O
after O
a O
fall O
due O
to O
the O
acute O
onset O
of O
left-sided O
weakness. O
Head O
CT O
showed O
hypodensity O
in O
the O
R O
MCA O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O

Follow-up O
head O
CT O
the O
morning O
after O
admission O
revealed O
hypodensity O
involving O
the O
entire O
R O
MCA O
territory. O
Because O
of O
malignant O
swelling, O
he O
went O
on O
to O
require O
hemicraniectomy O
which O
was O
performed O
by O
the O
Simmons O
Neurosurgery O
service. O
He O
recovered O
and O
was O
discharged O
to O
rehab O
on O
10/28 O
with O
left O
hemiplegia O
and O
dense O
left-sided O
neglect. O
Aspirin B-MEDICATION
was O
prescribed O
for O
stroke O
prophylaxis O
but O
was O
subsequently O
stopped O
at O
rehab O
for O
unclear O
reasons. O
His O
stroke O
work-up O
revealed O
a O
normal O
echocardiogram O
and O
24-hr O
Holter O
monitor. O
A O
hypercoagulability O
panel O
was O
negative. O
Homocysteine O
was O
normal. O
Serum O
lipid O
analysis O
revealed O
mild O
hypertriglyceridemia. O
The O
patient O
was O
re-admitted O
on O
12/02 O
with O
an O
abdominal O
bone O
flap O
infection. O
The O
flap O
was O
removed O
and O
long-term O
antibiotics O
prescribed. O
He O
did O
well O
and O
then O
was O
re-admitted O
01/01 O
with O
fever, O
headache, O
nausea, O
and O
vomiting. O
His O
hemicraniectomy O
site O
revealed O
protruding O
brain O
which O
required O
revision O
in O
the O
OR. O
Long-term O
antibiotics O
were O
again O
prescribed O
for O
possible O
infection O
of O
the O
site. O
The O
patient O
did O
well, O
but O
routine O
follow-up O
MRI O
of O
the O
cranium O
on O
3/8 O
shows O
a O
large, O
rim-enhancing, O
DWI O
bright O
fluid O
collection O
adjacent O
to O
the O
hemicraniectomy O
site. O
This O
may O
represent O
abscess. O
Dr. O
Bennett, O
Simmons O
Neurosurgery O
attending, O
intends O
to O
admit O
Mr. O
Rico O
3/27 O
for O
fluid O
sampling O
and O
culture. O
Additional O
operative O
intervention O
may O
be O
indicated O
if O
this O

is O
indeed O

Patient O
denies O
fever O
or O

He O
has O
had O
headaches O
frequently O
during O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
weeks. O
This O
was O
a O
major O
problem O
early O
in O
his O
course O
but O
then O
resolved. O
Mr. O
Rico O
has O
now O
been O
out O
of O
rehab O
for O
2 O
months, O
and O
he O
is O
doing O
quite O
well. O
He O
is O
able O
to O
walk O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
a O
four-post O
cane. O
His O
appetite O
is O
good, O
and O
he O
sleeps O
well O
on O
trazodone. O
He O
has O
a O
very O
close O
family O
who O
is O
intimately O
involved O
in O
his O
medical O
care. O
His O
spirits O
have O
been O
good O
considering O
the O
ordeal O
he O
has O
recently O
been O
through. O
While O
in O
rehab, O
his O
wife O
apparently O
deserted O
him O
after O
accruing O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
credit O
card O
debt O
from O
gambling. O
He O
cries O
when O
he O
tells O
me O
about O
this. O
A O
close O
female O
friend O
has O
moved O
in O
to O
his O
home O
and O
cares O
for O
him O
24 O
hours O
a O
day. O
He O
is O
able O
to O
assist O
with O
ADLs O
but O
cannot O
function O
independently. O
His O
left O
leg O
has O
some O
strength, O
but O
his O
arm O
remains O
completely O
paralyzed. O
There O
are O
occasional O
twitches O
in O
the O
thumb O
that O
are O
not O
voluntary. O
He O
has O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
left O
shoulder O
pain O
related O
to O
subluxation O
at O
that O
joint. O
An O
orthopedist O
suggested O
that O
the O
family O
consider O
shoulder O
fusion O
at O
some O
point O
in O
the O
future O
when O
the O
patient O
has O
recovered O
maximal O
function O
in O
the O
arm. O
He O
also O
has O
occasional O
hip O
pain O
on O
the O
same O
side O
that O
is O
less O
bothersome. O
Neurontin O
has O
been O
helpful O
for O
the O
shoulder O
pain, O
though O
the O
family O
believes O
that O
higher O
doses O
lead O
to O
a O
depressed O
mood. O

will O
try O
Elavil O
25 O
qhs. O
Patient O
will O
stop O

If O
Elavil O
is O
helpful, O
may O
increase O

after O
one O

therapy. O
Once O
Elavil O
up O
to O
50 O

would O
slowly O
taper O
Neurontin O
as O
per O
patient O
and O
family O
preference. O
At O
next O
appointment, O
if O
persistent O
left O

(which O
is O
likely), O
will O
encourage O
surgical O
fusion O
of O

HISTORY O
OF O
THE O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Nathan O
is O
a O
51-year-old, O
right-handed O
man O
who O
suffered O
a O
large O
right O
MCA O
territory O
stroke O
in O
October O
2069. O
This O
occurred O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
right O
internal O
carotid O
artery O
occlusion, O
and O
hemicraniectomy O
was O
required O
for O
management O
of O
malignant O
cerebral O
edema O
after O
the O
stroke. O
He O
subsequently O
developed O
an O
infection O
of O
the O
abdominal O
bone O
flap. O
His O
stroke O
workup O
revealed O
a O
normal O
echocardiogram O
and O
24-hour O
Holter O
monitor. O
A O
hypercoagulability O
panel O
was O
negative. O
Homocysteine O
was O
normal. O
Serum O
lipid O
analysis O
revealed O
mild O
hypertriglyceridemia. O
His O
recovery O
was O
complicated O
by O
brain O
abscess, O
which O
required O
surgical O
drainage O
and O
prolonged O
antibiotic O
therapy. O
Finally O
an O
artificial O
bone O
flap O
was O
replaced O
in O
October O
2070. O
He O
then O
developed O
persistent O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
and O
a O
pseudomeningocele. O
A O
VP O
shunt O
was O
placed O
by O
Dr. O
Bennett. O
Unfortunately, O
even O
after O
shunting O
there O
was O
persistent O
nausea O
and O
vomiting. O
This O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
Fentanyl O
patch O
use. O
The O
Fentanyl O
was O
subsequently O
replaced O
with O
methadone O
for O
chronic O
left-sided O
neuropathic O
pain, O
and O
the O
nausea O
and O
vomiting O
abated. O
I O
last O
saw O
Nathan O
on O
April O
2nd O
of O
this O
year O
at O
which O
point O
he O
was O
doing O
quite O
well. O
He O
complained O
of O
some O
hot O
flashes O
of O
unclear O
etiology. O
His O
depression O
seemed O
to O
be O
under O
better O
control O
on O
Celexa. O
Today O
he O
reports O
that O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
trouble O
with O
neuropathic O
pain O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
body. O
Fortunately O
he O
has O
managed O
to O
wean O
himself O
off O
of O
methadone O
and O
this O
has O
not O
caused O
the O
pain O
to O
get O
any O
worse. O
He O
is O
using O
a O
substantial O
dose O
of O
Neurontin, O
which O
he O
thinks O
is O
helpful. O
He O
complains O
that O
these O
pains O
involve O
his O
face, O
arm, O
and O
leg O
on O
the O
left O
side O
and O
he O
wonders O
whether O
there O
might O
be O
some O
relationship O
between O
the O
pain O
and O
the O
shunt, O
which O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
head. O
He O
also O
complains O
of O
occasional O
leg O
spasms O
at O
night, O
which O
are O
not O
particularly O
bothersome. O
His O
most O
significant O
complaint O
at O
this O
time O
relates O
to O
the O
hot O
flashes O
that O
he O
mentioned O
at O
our O
last O
visit. O
These O
often O
occur O
several O
times O
daily, O
although O
they O
may O
not O
occur O
for O
several O
days O
at O
a O
time. O
He O
explains O
that O
most O
of O
the O
episodes O
occur O
when O
he O
is O
in O
bed O
at O
night. O
He O
first O
develops O
a O
feeling O
of O
nausea O
followed O
by O
a O
cold O
sensation O
on O
one O
side O
of O
his O
body O
or O
the O
other. O
This O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
a O
feeling O
of O
heat O
from O
the O
top O
of O
his O
head O
down O
to O
his O
toes. O
There O
may O
be O
a O
feeling O
of O
urinary O
urgency. O
He O
then O
experiences O
a O
sensation O
as O
if O
he O
is O
floating O
on O
the O
bed, O
and O
generally O
this O
is O
followed O
by O
nausea. O
The O
entire O
episode O
lasts O
only O
seconds O
but O
the O
nausea O
may O
persist O
for O
as O
long O
as O
an O
hour. O
He O
also O
notes O
on O
some O
mornings O
he O
does O
not O
feel O
like O
getting O
out O
of O
bed. O
He O
continues O
to O
experience O
depressed O
mood, O
and O
he O
longs O
to O
return O
to O
a O
normal O
state O
of O
functioning. O
He O
has O
returned O
to O
volunteering O
as O
a O
Big O
Brother. O
He O
is O
unable O
to O
work. O
His O
divorce O
is O
now O
complete O
and O
he O
is O
really O
glad O
about O
this. O
He O
is O
living O
with O
a O
friend O
named O
Tejeda O
who O
takes O
excellent O
care O
of O
him. O
His O
left O
arm O
remains O
paralyzed. O
He O
has O
minimal O
proximal O
strength O
in O
his O
leg. O
He O
has O
a O
dense O
visual O
field O
deficit O
on O
the O
left O
side. O
He O
has O
one O
new O
complaint O
which O
is O
a O
feeling O
of O
numbness O
and O
tingling O
in O
the O
4th O
and O
5th O
fingers O
on O
the O
right O

On O
exam O
Nathan O
is O
well-appearing. O
His O
hair O
has O
now O
grown O
back. O
On O
mental O
status O
exam O
he O
is O
able O
to O
relate O
a O
cogent O
history. O
He O
has O
a O
number O
of O
questions O
about O
stroke O
rehabilitation O
possibilities O
including O
a O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
program O
that O
he O
learned O
about O
in O
Connecticut. O
Eye O
contact O
is O
good. O
On O
cranial O
nerve O
exam O
pupils O
are O
round O
and O
reactive O
and O
extraocular O
movements O
are O
intact. O
There O
is O
a O
left O
visual O
field O
deficit. O
The O
face O
is O
asymmetric O
with O
an O
upper O
motor O
neuron O
pattern O
left O
facial O
droop. O
The O
tongue O
protrudes O
in O
the O
midline. O
The O
left O
arm O
is O
completely O
plegic. O
The O
left O
leg O
has O
greater O
than O
anti-gravity O
proximal O
strength. O
There O
is O
left-sided O
sensory O
extinction. O
Reflexes O
are O
brisk O
on O
the O
left O
and O
normal O
on O
the O
right. O
Nathan O
is O
able O
to O
ambulate O
with O
a O
cane O
and O
a O
left O
ankle O
foot O
orthosis. O
We O
spent O
much O
of O
today's O
visit O
discussing O
various O
issues O
that O
concern O
Nathan. O
Regarding O
the O
possibility O
of O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
therapy O
for O
stroke O
rehabilitation. O
I O
explained O
that O
there O
is O
no O
convincing O
evidence O
in O
favor O
of O
this O
approach. O
There O
are O
some O
risks O
to O
hyperbaric O
oxygen O
therapy O
such O
as O
lung O
injury O
and O
the O
programs O
are O
extremely O
costly. O
Therefore O
I O
advised O
Nathan O
not O
to O
pursue O
that O
option. O
Regarding O
his O
frequent O
hot O
flashes, O
which O
are O
very O
bothersome, O
the O
etiology O
of O
these O
episodes O
is O
quite O
unclear. O
Dr. O
Mays O
mentioned O
the O
possibility O
that O
these O
episodes O
represent O
some O
sort O
of O
diencephalic O
paroxysmal O
discharges. O
I O
think O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
these O
are O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
Celexa; O
I O
believe O
that O
they O
first O
occurred O
shortly O
after O
starting O
Celexa. O
We O
decided O
to O
stop O
the O
Celexa O
for O
a O
2-week O
period O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
any O
improvement O
in O
the O
episodes. O
If O
there O
is, O
I O
would O
consider O
changing O
to O
an O
antidepressant O
that O
works O
by O
a O
different O
mechanism. O
If O
there O
is O
no O
change O
in O
the O
episodes O
we O
can O
go O
ahead O
and O
add O
Celexa O
back. O
I O
neglected O
to O
mention O
above O
that O
there O
is O
sensory O
loss O
to O
temperature O
and O
pinprick O
in O
the O
right O
hand O
involving O
the O
4th O
and O
5th O
digits O
and O
the O
ulnar O
aspect O
of O
the O
hand O
on O
the O
palmar O
surface. O
There O
is O
no O
motor O
dysfunction O
in O
the O
hand. O
There O
is O
no O
Tinel's O
sign O
over O
the O
ulnar O
nerve O
at O
the O
elbow. O
The O
ulnar O
nerve O
in O
the O
ulnar O
groove O
is O
not O
hypermobile. O
The O
symptoms O
and O
physical O
exam O
are O
consistent O
with O
ulnar O
entrapment O
neuropathy, O
which O
I O
suspect O
is O
the O
result O
of O
arm O
flexion O
during O
sleep. O
I O
suggested O
that O
Nathan O
buy O
an O
elbow O
pad O
with O
a O
Velcro O
strap O
that O
will O
help O
facilitate O
keeping O
the O
arm O
straight O
during O
sleep. O
We O
will O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
this O
over O
time. O
No O
other O
changes O
are O
indicated O
at O
the O
moment. O
I O
intend O
to O
see O
Nathan O
in O
followup O
in O
about O
6 O
months. O

and O
hyponatremia. O
Patient O
states O
over O
the O
past O
2 O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN O
Ms. O
Ostrander O
is O
a O
64 O
yo O
Peruvian O
woman O
with O
schizophrenia, O
HTN, O
DM2, O
HL O
presenting O
with O
confusion O
and O
found O
to O
have O
significant O
metabolic O
disarray O
including O
hyponatremia, O
hypokalemia, O
hypochloremia O
and O
an O
anion O
gap. O
She O
also O
has O
a O
mild O
leukocytosis, O
anemia O
&#8211; O
at O
baseline, O
and O
thrombocytosis. O
##: O
Hyponatremia O
&#8211; O
Calculated O
serum O
osmolality O
is O
248 O
mOsm/L O
(measured O
241) O
suggesting O
a O
hypotonic O
hyponatremia. O
Clinically O
she O
appears O
euvolemic, O
despite O
having O
a O
dry O
mouth O
which O
may O
be O
from O
patient&#8217;s O
antipsychotics. O
A O
Uosm O
of O
62 O
is O
most O
suggestive O
of O
primary O
polydipsia O
vs. O
low O
solute. O
Patient O
is O
drinking O
2L O
coke/day O
and O
complaining O
of O
excessive O
thirst, O
per O
PCP/psych O
notes O
she O
is O
told O
to O
limit O
fluids O
to O
1L. O
Interestingly O
this O
may O
have O
been O
precipitated O
by O
switching O
from O
diet O
coke O
to O
coke O
as O
diet O
coke O
contains O
30mg O
Na O
and O
0gm O
carbs O
while O
regular O
coke O
contains O
45mg O
Na O
and O
39gm O
carbohydrates. O
Increased O
carbohydrates O
with O
little O
sodium, O
protein O
or O
potassium O
load O
(such O
as O
in O
beer O
potomania) O
can O
inhibit O
protein O
breakdown O
and O
urea O
excretion, O
therefore O
decreasing O
daily O
solute O
excretion O
to O
&lt;250mOsm, O
which O
can O
result O
in O

if O
fluid O

is O
~800-1000 O
