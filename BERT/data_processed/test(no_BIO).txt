Mr. O
Villegas O
is O
seen O
today. O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
him O
since O
November. O
About O
three O
weeks O
ago O
he O
stopped O
his O
Prednisone O
on O
his O
own O
because O
he O
was O
gaining O
weight. O
He O
does O
feel O
that O
his O
shoulders O
are O
definitely O
improved. O
It O
is O
unclear O
what O
he O
is O
actually O
taking, O
but O
I O
think O
based O
on O
the O
color O
of O
his O
pills O
and O
the O
timing O
of O
the O
medication O
that O
he O
continues O
taking O
his O
Atenolol MEDICATION
for O
hypertension HYPERTENSION
and O
1 O
Hydroxychloroquine O
tablet. O
He O
is O
concerned O
because O
of O
the O
relatively O
recent O
onset O
of O
difficulties O
turning O
his O
head O
to O
the O
right. O
When O
he O
does O
this, O
he O
will O
note O
that O
he O
feels O
as O
though O
he O
is O
going O
to O
pass O
out O
although O
this O
has O
not O
actually O
happened. O
This O
only O
occurs O
when O
he O
turns O
to O
the O
right O
and O
not O
to O
the O
left. O
He O
has O
no O
visual O
changes O
otherwise O
and O
denies O
any O
headache O
or O
other O
cranial O
complaints. O
On O
examination O
today, O
BP O
120/80. O
He O
has O
no O
bruits O
over O
the O
carotid. O
He O
has O
no O
tenderness O
in O
this O
region O
either. O
He O
has O
good O
peripheral O
pulses O
at O
the O
arms. O
His O
joint O
examination O
is O
much O
improved O
with O
better O
ROM O
of O
the O
shoulders O
and O
no O
peripheral O
joint O
synovitis. O
Clinical O
Impression: O
#1: O
Inflammatory O
arthritis O
- O
possibly O
RA O
- O
with O
response O
noted O
to O
Hydroxychloroquine O
along O
with O
Prednisone. O
He O
has O
stopped O
the O
Prednisone, O
and O
I O
would O
not O
restart O
it O
yet. O
#2: O
New O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
suspicious O
for O
right-sided O
carotid O
disease. O
Will O
arrange O
for O
carotid O
ultrasound O
studies. O
Patient O
advised O
to O
call O
me O
if O
he O
develops O
any O
worsening O
symptoms. O
He O
has O
been O
taking O
1 O
aspirin MEDICATION
per O
day O
prophylaxis O
long-term, O
and O
I O
stressed O
that O
he O
continue O
to O
do O
so. O
He O
will O
follow-up O
with O
me O
shortly O
after O
the O

Dear O
Dr. O
Law: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Hess O
in O
followup O
in O
Cardiology O
today. O
As O
you O
know, O
he O
is O
a O
53-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
underwent O
implantation O
of O
a O
permanent O
pacemaker O
on O
02/11/60 O
for O
presyncope O
and O
pauses O
on O
Holter O
monitoring. O
His O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
hyperlipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
gastroesophageal O
reflux O
disease, O
and O
asthma. O
Prior O
to O
his O
pacemaker O
placement, O
an O
exercise O
stress O
test O
was O
performed O
because O
of O
his O
history O
of O
exertional O
chest O
pain. O
He O
was O
able O
to O
exercise O
for O
8 O
minutes O
and O
4 O
seconds. O
The O
test O
was O
terminated O
for O
7/10 O
substernal O
chest O
pain, O
but O
no O
hypotension O
and O
no O
overt O
EKG O
changes O
were O
noted, O
so O
we O
proceeded O
with O
the O
pacemaker O
implant. O
Since O
the O
implant O
Mr. O
Hess O
describes O
that O
his O
intermittent O
symptoms O
of O
lightheadedness O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath O
have O
vanished, O
however, O
he O
has O
noticed O
that O
he O
is O
sleeping O
less O
well O
and O
occasionally O
has O
nocturnal O
palpitations, O
which O
potentially O
could O
represent O
pacing O
from O
his O
pacemaker. O
Interrogation O
today O
of O
his O
Medtronic O
Kappa O
QQ O
626 O
pacemaker O
reveals O
that O
his O
underlying O
rhythm O
is O
sinus O
tachycardia O
with O
intact O
AV O
conduction. O
His O
estimated O
battery O
longevity O
is O
89 O
months. O
The O
atrial O
impedance O
is O
569 O
ohms, O
the O
ventricular O
impedance O
is O
529 O
ohms. O
The O
P-wave O
is O
5.6 O
mV. O
The O
R-wave O
is O
31.3 O
mV. O
The O
threshold O
in O
the O
atrium O
is O
0.75 O
V O
at O
0.4 O
mV, O
and O
the O
threshold O
in O
the O
ventricle O
is O
0.75 O
V O
at O
0.4 O
msec. O
In O
summary, O
Mr. O
Hess O
is O
doing O
extremely O
well O
after O
his O
pacemaker O
placement. O
His O
pacemaker O
incision O
is O
extremely O
well O
healed. O
There O
is O
no O
sign O
of O
erythema O
or O
hematoma. O
However, O
his O
sinus O
tachycardia O
is O
mildly O
perplexing. O
Looking O
at O
his O
heart O
rate O
histogram, O
it O
appears O
that O
this O
sinus O
rates O
have O
varied O
from O
80-120 O
beats O
per O
minute O
for O
the O
most O
part O
aside O
from O
some O
low O
heart O
rate O
that O
potentially O
are O
nocturnal. O
I O
have O
performed O
some O
pacing O
maneuvers O
today O
in O
clinic O
to O
attempt O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
mechanism O
of O
his O
current O
tachycardia O
is O
sinus O
and O
it O
appears O
that O
this O
is O
sinus O
tachycardia. O
For O
this O
reason, O
I O
have O
performed O
a O
TSH O
today, O
which O
is O
normal, O
however, O
I O
suggest O
to O
you O
that O
potentially O
a O
cursory O
endocrine O
workup O
and O

Dear O
Dr. O
Gordon: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Hess O
in O
followup O
in O
Cardiology O
today. O
As O
you O
know, O
he O
is O
a O
54-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
underwent O
implantation O
of O
a O
permanent O
pacemaker O
on O
02/11/2060 O
for O
his O
presyncope O
and O
pauses O
on O
Holter O
monitoring. O
His O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
hyperlipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
gastroesophageal O
reflux O
disease, O
and O
asthma. O
Prior O
to O
his O
pacemaker O
placement, O
an O
exercise O
stress O
test O
was O
performed O
because O
of O
a O
history O
of O
exertional O
chest O
pain. O
He O
was O
able O
to O
exercise O
for O
8 O
minutes O
and O
4 O
seconds. O
The O
test O
was O
terminated CAD
for CAD
7/10 CAD
substernal CAD
chest CAD
pain, CAD
but O
no O
hypotension O
or O
overt O
ECG O
changes O
were O
noted. O
We O
proceeded O
to O
pacemaker O
implant O
and O
Mr. O
Hess O
has O
done O
well O
since O
that O
time. O
He O
remarks O
that O
his O
intermittent O
symptoms O
of O
lightheadedness O
have O
resolved. O
However, O
he O
occasionally O
still O
has O
nocturnal O
palpitations O
as O
well O
as O
occasional O
exertional O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
tells O
me O
that O
he O
underwent O
testing O
at O
Wheatland O
Memorial O
consisting O
of O
a O
stress CAD
test CAD
with CAD
MIBI CAD
imaging CAD
that CAD
perhaps CAD
showed CAD
an CAD
abnormality, CAD
though O
the O
report O
of O
this O
test O
is O
not O
available O
to O
me O
today O
for O
review. O
Interrogation O
today O
of O
his O
Medtronic O
Kappa O
CTE O
226 O
pacemaker O
reveals O
that O
his O
underlying O
rhythm O
is O
sinus O
tachycardia O
with O
intact O
AV O
conduction. O
The O
estimated O
longevity O
on O
the O
battery O
life O
is O
95 O
months. O
The O
atrial O
impedance O
is O
544 O
ohms O
and O
the O
ventricular O
impedance O
is O
519 O
ohms. O
The O
P-wave O
in O
the O
atrium O
is O
5.6 O
mV O
and O
the O
R-wave O
in O
the O
ventricle O
is O
31 O
mV. O
The O
threshold O
in O
the O
atrium O
is O
stable O
at O
0.5 O
V O
at O
0.4 O
msec, O
and O
the O
threshold O
in O
the O
ventricle O
is O
also O
stable O
at O
0.5 O
V O
at O
0.4 O
msec. O
In O
summary, O
the O
pacemaker O
appears O
to O
be O
working O
quite O
well. O
However, O
Mr. O
Hess O
persists O
in O
a O
perplexing O
sinus O
tachycardia O
that O
has O
been O
present O
since O
his O
last O
pacemaker O
interrogation. O
I O
have O
therefore O
ordered O
an O
echocardiogram O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
ill O
effects O
of O
the O
sinus O
tachycardia O
or O
any O
structural O
heart O
disease O
that O
may O
be O
causing O
the O
sinus O
tachycardia. O
In O
addition, O
I O
have O
performed O
a O
12-lead O
ECG, O
which O
appears O
to O
show O
sinus O
mechanism O
rather O
than O
an O
atrial O
tachycardia. O
Today O
in O
the O
office, O
his O
sinus O
rate O
is O
109 O
beats O
per O
minute O
with O
stable O
blood O
pressure. O
Mr. O
Hess O
and O
I O
have O
checked O
thyroid O
studies O
in O
the O
recent O
past O
and O
those O
have O
been O
unremarkable. O
I O
have O
discussed O
this O
case O
with O
Dr. O
Quatrell O
Swanson O
who O
has O
agreed O
to O
assist O
in O
Cardiology O
care O
for O
Mr. O
Hess O
in O
the O
near O
future, O
since O
Dr. O
Law O
is O
moving O
his O
practice O
to O
the O
NCHC. O
I O
plan O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Hess O
in O
followup O
in O
three O
months' O
time O
for O
his O
pacemaker. O
If O
any O
issues O
arise O
in O
the O
interim, O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me. O
Sincerely, O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
He O
has O
not O
had O
recurrent O
angina. O
Unfortunately, O
we O
did O
not O
connect O
back O
in O
December O
following O
the O
receipt O
of O
his O
lipid O
data O
that O
included O
a O
marked O
and O
unacceptable O
LDL O
elevation. O
We O
had O
left O
a O
message O
with O
his O
daughter, O
Lea. O
Additional O
laboratory O
data O
at O
that O
time O
included O
a O
hemoglobin O
A1c O
of O
6.2%. O
He O
is O
seeking O
to O
establish O
a O
new O
relationship O
with O
a O
primary O
care O
physician O
through O
Barney O
Convalescent O
Hospital. O
He O
has O
also O
had O
problems O
of O
at O
least O
2 O
years O
duration O
with O
erectile O
dysfunction O
and O
decreased O
libido. O
MEDICATIONS: O
His O
medications O
are O
atenolol MEDICATION
50 O
mg O
b.i.d., O
atorvastatin MEDICATION
80 O
mg O
daily, O
ezetimibe MEDICATION
10 O
mg O
daily, O
Ecotrin MEDICATION
325 O
mg O
daily, O
Prilosec O
20 O
mg O
daily. O
He O
apparently O
ran MEDICATION
out MEDICATION
of MEDICATION
his MEDICATION
clopidogrel MEDICATION
some O
time O
ago O
and O
did O
not O
renew O
the O
prescription. O
It O
was O
his O
understanding O
that O
he O
was O
to O
remain O
on O
this O
medication O
for O
only O
six O
months O
following O
the O
PCI O
procedure. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
His O
heart O
rate O
at O
rest O
is O
105. O
His O
initial O
blood O
pressure O
149/96, HYPERTENSION
but HYPERTENSION
then HYPERTENSION
150/82 HYPERTENSION
on HYPERTENSION
repeat, HYPERTENSION
using O
a O
large O
cuff. O
His O
weight O
is O
down O
4 O
pounds O
to O
193. O
His O
venous O
pressure O
and O

upstrokes O
are O
normal. O
His O
lung O
fields O
are O
clear. O
He O
has O
no O
cardiac O
murmur. O
There O
are O
no O
pulse O
deficits O
or O
peripheral O
edema. O
His O
ECG O
shows O
a O
sinus O
tachycardia O
(after O
rushing O
into O
the O
office) O
and O
an O
incomplete O
right O
bundle-branch O
block O
pattern O
with O
a O
normal O
QRS O
duration. O
In O
comparison O
with O
his O
tracing O
from O
12/24/2060, O
his O
resting O
heart O
rate O
has O
increased. O
ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
He O
will O
keep O
a O
diary O
of O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
recordings O
over O
the O
next O
month O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
which O
we O
will O
determine O
next O
steps. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
higher O
dose O
beta-blocker O
contributes O
to O
his O
erectile O
dysfunction, O
though O
the O
problem O
may O
have O
antedated O
this O
medication O
altogether. O
We O
will O
refer O
him O

his O
efforts O
at O
weight O
loss. O
He O
is O
working O
out O
at O
the O
gym O
2-3 O
times O

IMAGING O
STUDIES: O
EKG O
demonstrates O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
nonspecific O
ST-T O
wave O
changes. O
Plain O
films O
of O
the O
abdomen O
demonstrates O
scattered O
dilated O
loops O
of O
small O
bowel O
but O
no O
clear O
obstruction O
consistent O
with O
possible O
ileus O
versus O
early O
obstruction. O
Chest O
x-ray O
shows O
low O
lung O
volumes O
without O
any O
focal O
consolidation. O
IMPRESSION: O
This O
is O
a O
patient O
with O
abdominal O
distention, O
is O
quite O
impressive O
as O
well O
as O
a O
firm O
belly O
with O
dilated O
loops O
of O
bowel O
on O
his O
KUB O
as O
well O
as O
history O
of O
vomiting O
earlier O
this O
evening. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
vomiting O
here O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
nauseated, O
however, O
does O
not O
have O
an O
appetite. O
He O
has O
had O
decreased O
urine O
output O
and O
managed O
to O
put O
out O
a O
total O
25 O
cc O
of O
urine O
through O
his O
Foley O
since O
2:00 O
p.m. O
today. O
Presently, O
he O
was O
not O
tender O
over O
his O
bladder. O
Upon O
flushing O
the O
Foley, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
debris. O
They O
came O
out O
and O
followed O
by O
high O
pressure O
urine O
that O
had O
malodorous O
character O
to O
it. O
I O
think O
this O
patient O
likely O
has O
an O
ileus O
and O
urinary O
tract O
infection. O
He O
received O
antibiotics O
wide O
spectrum O
including O
vancomycin, O
levofloxacin O
and O
Flagyl O
initially O
followed O
by O
gentamicin O
given O
his O
prior O
levofloxacin O
resistance. O
PRIMARY O
DIAGNOSIS: O
Urinary O
tract O
infection. O
SECONDARY O
DIAGNOSIS: O
Ileus O
versus O
SBO. O
The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
ED O
Observation O
Area O
for O
CT O
imaging, O
however O
will O
eventually O
require O
admission O
for O
this O
problem O
likely O
to O
Medicine O
Service. O
DISPOSITION: O
Admitted O
to O
ED O
Observation O

The O
most O
likely O
etiology O
in O
this O

is O
his O
urinary O

His O
urine O

Prior O
to O

changed. O
He O
then O
began O
to O
no O

drain O
urine. O
Accordingly, O
a O
bladder O
probe O
was O
put O
on O

clearly O
showed O
a O

Attempts O
were O
made O

change O
the O

Illness O
Mr. O

to O
the O

today O
for O
an O
initial O
visit O
and O
second O
opinion O
for O
left-sided O
weakness O
starting O
in O
6/25/32. O
He O
was O
golfing O
at O
the O
time, O
and O
suddenly O
developed O
weakness O
with O
no O
sensory O
changes. O
The O
weakness O
involved O
the O
face, O
arm O
and O
leg O
on O
the O
left O
side O
only. O
He O
went O
to O
Gilmore O

checked O
his O
blood O
pressure, O
and O
found O
it O
to O
be O
220/140 HYPERTENSION
(per O
his O
report). O
A O
CT O
scan O
was O
performed, O
and O
he O
was O
informed O
that O
it O
was O
normal. O
He O
became O
frustrated O
with O
the O
ER O
there O
and O
signed O
out O

He O
went O
to O
the O
HCH O
at O

2 O
days O

his O
BP O
was O

elevated, O
and O
they O

which O
explains O
his O
pure O

I O
have O
counseled O
him O
that O
most O
likely O
the O
best O
treatment O
for O
this O
type O
of O
stroke O
is O
to O
control O
his O
hypertension, O
and O
to O
use O
antiplatelet O
agents. O
I O
have O
asked O
that O
he O
increase O
his O
dose O
of O
ASA O
to O
325 O
mg O
per O
day. O
In O
addition, O
he O
needs O
a O
work O

I O
have O
arranged O
for O
him O
to O
have O
CNIS, O
24 O

monitoring, O
and O
TTE O
with O

Additionally, O
we O
should O

He O
wishes O
to O
have O
a O
PCP O
at O

and O
I O
have O
requested O
that O
he O
have O
the O
next O
available O
appointment O
with O
Dr. O
Harry O
Tolliver O
of O
the O
cardiology O
department, O
who O
could O
also O
be O
instrumental O
in O
adjusting O
his O
hypertension O
meds. O
He O
will O
return O
to O
clinic O
in O
2-3 O

and O
is O
to O

with O

He O
has O
had O
no O

and O
only O
very O
infrequently O
feels O
that O
the O
right O
leg O
is O
weak, O
usually O
at O
the O

He O
was O
recently O
seen O
by O
Dr. O

the O

of O

He O
underwent O
a O
24-hour O

which O
showed O
no O

NOTE O
DIAGNOSIS: O
Recurrent O
renal O
cell O
carcinoma. O
HISTORY: O
Mr. O
Slater O
is O
a O
delightful O
and O
active O
80-year-old O
man O
who O
was O
incidentally O
found O
to O
have O
a O
renal O
mass O
in O
2133. O
At O
that O
time O
Dr. O
Updike O
performed O
a O
left O
partial O
nephrectomy, O
and O
the O
final O
pathology O
showed O
a O
1.5 O
cm O
clear O
cell O
renal O
cell O
carcinoma. O
Since O
that O
date O
he O
has O
remained O
well O
with O
no O
clinical O
evidence O
of O
recurrent O
disease O
and O
has O
had O
interval O
CT O
scans. O
For O
the O
last O
2 O
years, O
enhancing O
nodules O
have O
been O
noted O
within O
the O
region O
of O
the O
partial O
nephrectomy. O
A O
biopsy O
performed O
approximately O
1 O
year O
ago O
did O
not O
demonstrate O
any O
cancer O
within O
modestly O
enlarged O
retroperitoneal O
lymph O
nodes. O
CT O
scan O
was O
repeated O
in O
December O
of O
2137. O
This O
again O
showed O
some O
enlarged O
retroperitoneal O
adenopathy O
and O
also O
enlargement O
of O
the O
soft O
tissue O
nodules. O
Biopsy O
in O
March O
of O
this O
year O
showed O
probable O
recurrent O
renal O
cell O
carcinoma O
of O
the O
clear O
cell O
type O
within O
the O
nodules. O
Biopsy O
of O
an O
adjacent O
adrenal O
gland O
showed O
no O
cancer. O
His O
metastatic O
workup O
has O
included O
CT O
scans O
of O
the O
chest, O
which O
have O
demonstrated O
small O
pulmonary O
nodules O
of O
uncertain O
significance. O
He O
has O
met O
with O
Drs. O
Eagle O
and O
Yzaguirre. O
Both O
have O
recommended O
completion O
of O
the O
nephrectomy O
and O
resection O
of O
any O
visible O
tumor, O
perhaps O
with O
intraoperative O
radiation O
as O

Re: O

Dear O
Wanda: O
Nancy O
Werner O
is O
doing O
better O
than O
the O
last O
time O
I O
saw O
her O
in O
May O
in O
that O
the O
triglycerides O
have O
decreased O
to O
460, O
pretty O
much O
where O
they O
had O
usually O
been. O
The O
LDL O
is O
now O
quite O
low O
at O
93 O
but O
the O
HDL O
has O
declined O
to O
34. O
All O
in O
all, O
the O
results O
are O
compatible O
with O
better O
glucose O
control O
and O
the O
action O
of O
Atorvastatin MEDICATION
10 O
mg O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
the O
very O
low O
LDL O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
discontinuation MEDICATION
of MEDICATION
the MEDICATION
gemfibrozil MEDICATION
probably O
lowered O
the O
HDL. O
The O
effect O
on O
triglycerides O
of O
the O
low O
dose O
of O
the O
Atorvastatin O
is O
minimal O
and O
overall O
the O
triglyceride O
lowering O
effect O
is O
overrated O
except O
at O
the O
high O
dose O
of O
80 O
mg. O
Even O
at O
80 O
mg O
Atorvastatin O
could O
not O
compare O
to O
the O
fibrates O
in O
the O
triglyceride O
lowering O
action. O
Her O
current O
medications O
are O
Atorvastatin O
10 O
mg, O
Lopressor MEDICATION
25 O
mg, O
Procardia MEDICATION
60 O

the MEDICATION

600 O
mg O
b.i.d. O
and O
left O
her O
on O
the O
Atorvastatin O
10 O
mg. O
Although O
I O
don't O
expect O
any O
side O
effects O
with O
this O
low O
dose O
of O
Atorvastatin O
and O
Gemfibrozil O
I O
warned O
Mrs. O
Werner O
and O
her O
husband O
that O
if O
she O
should O
have O
generalized O
muscle O
aches O
or O
weakness O
she O
should O
contact O
us O
and O
discontinue O
medication. O
I O
think O
that O
aggressive O
therapy O
is O
warranted O
in O
Mrs. O
Werner. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Xayarath: O
Your O
patient O
Mr. O
Earnest O
Branche O
returned O
to O
the O
office O
today O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
visit. O
As O
you O
know, O
Mr. O
Branche O
underwent O
a O
left O
femoral O
to O
posterior O
tibial O
bypass O
one O
month O
ago O
followed O
by O
amputation O
of O
a O
gangrenous O
first O
toe. O
After O
being O
discharged O
from O
our O
service O
he O
was O
readmitted O
to O
the O
Medical O
Service O
with O
a O
severe O
case O
of O
C. O
difficile O
colitis. O
Ultimately O
this O
resolved O
and O
he O
was O
discharged. O
Today O
he O
reports O
that O
the O
diarrhea O
has O
again O
resumed O
and O
he O
was O
placed O
back O
on O
an O
oral O
antibiotic O
yesterday. O
He O
complains O
of O
only O
mild O
incisional O
discomfort O
in O
his O
left O
leg. O
On O
examination, O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
pulse O
easily O
palpated O
over O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft. O
The O
old O
right O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
was O
also O
palpable. O
The O
left O
foot O
itself O
is O
warm. O
The O
great O
toe O
incision O
site, O
however, O
has O
developed O
necrotic O
tissue O
all O
along O
the O
incision, O
which O
was O
sharply O
debrided O
to O
clean O
margins. O
This O
will O
now O
need O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
an O
open O
wound. O
The O
calf O
portion O
of O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
incision O
also O
has O
a O
narrow O
zone O
of O
superficial O
skin O
slough O
which O
was O
gently O
debrided. O
The O
graft O
is O
not O
exposed O
and O
there O
are O
no O
deep O
wounds O
in O
the O
leg. O
Mr. O
Branche's O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
is O
functioning O
well. O
However, O
he O
will O
require O
significant O
ongoing O
wound O
care O
for O
the O
immediate O
future. O
Daily O
dressing O
changes O
will O
be O
arranged O
with O
visiting O
nurse O
services. O
We O
plan O
to O
follow O
him O
closely O
and O
an O
appointment O
was O
given O
for O
two O
weeks. O
Thanks O
again O
for O
allowing O
us O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
this O
delightful O
and O
challenging O
patient O

RE:Branch, O
Earnest O
MRN:53023691 O
Dear O
Dr. O
Xayarath: O
Your O
patient O
Earnest O
Branch O
came O
in O
the O
office O
today O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
visit. O
Mr. O
Branch O
is O
now O
two O
years O
out O
from O
a O
right O
femoral- O
tibial O
bypass O
and O
nine O
months O
out O
from O
a O
left O
femoral-tibial O
bypass O
with O
subsequent O
transmetatarsal O
amputation O
of O
the O
left O
foot O
and O
split-thickness O
skin O
grafting. O
Over O
the O
last O
several O
months, O
he O
has O
been O
undergoing O
dressing O
changes O
to O
remaining, O
small, O
superficial, O
open O
wounds O
on O
the O
dorsum O
of O
the O
left O
foot. O
Over O
the O
last O
one O
to O
two O
weeks, O
he O
began O
to O
note O
the O
development O
of O
a O
new O
area O
of O
dark O
skin O
on O
the O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O
left O
foot O
and O
recently O
has O
noted O
some O
drainage. O
He O
denies O
any O
fevers. O
In O
addition O
and O
of O
note, O
he O
complains O
of O
recent O
onset O
of O
pain O
in O
the O
right O
eye O
and O
has O
an O
appointment O
at O
the O
Ophthalmology O
Clinic O
immediately O
following O
his O
visit O
with O
us. O
He O
last O
underwent O
vascular O
lab O
studies O
in O
September O
at O
which O
time O
both O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafts O
were O
widely O
patent O
and O
without O
stenoses. O
On O
examination O
today, O
there O
are O
strong, O
easily O
palpable O
pulses O
over O
both O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafts. O
The O
right O
foot O
is O
warm O
and O
without O
any O
new O
ischemic O
skin O
changes O
or O
lesions. O
On O
examination O
of O
the O
left O
foot, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
area O
of O
full- O
thickness O
skin O
necrosis O
on O
the O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O
foot O
where O
there O
had O
never O
been O
any O
previous O
open O
wounds. O
This O
area O
encompasses O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
the O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O
foot O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
transmetatarsal O
incision O
to O
the O
proximal O
mid O
foot. O
On O
probing, O
purulent O
material O
drains O
from O
the O
margins O
and O
there O
is O
obvious O
significant O
sepsis. O
The O
foot O
itself O
is O
warm O
and O
there O
is O
a O
good O
posterior O
tibial O
Doppler O
signal O
at O
the O
ankle. O
Unfortunately, O
Mr. O
Branch O
has O
developed O
a O
new, O
large O
wound O
on O
the O
left O
foot O
which O
likely O
began O
as O
a O
pressure O
(decubitus) O
ulceration O
due O
to O
his O
severe O
neuropathy. O
This O
is O
now O
complicated O
by O
significant O
local O
sepsis O
and O
there O
is O
a O
large O
area O
of O
soft O
tissue O
loss O
on O
the O
foot. O
He O
will O
require O
urgent O
admission O
and O
operative O
debridement O
today. O
In O
addition, O
given O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
problem, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
he O
will O
ultimately O
come O
to O
below-knee O
amputation O
in O
the O
end. O
Immediately O
following O
his O
visit O
to O
the O
Ophthalmology O
Clinic, O
he O
will O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O

He O
initially O
did O

At O
that O
time, O
he O
developed O
acute O
cholecystitis O
and O
post-ERCP O
pancreatitis O
which O
was O
complicated O
by O
phlegmon O

admitted O
to O
PNC O
in O

cyst-jejunostomy. O
He O
underwent O
the O
GI O
surgery O
on O
1/11/18. O
His O
post-operative O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
recurrent O
GIB O
upon O
re-initiation O
of O
anti-coagulation O
for O
the O
mechanical O
AVR O
that O
prolonged O
his O
hospital O
stay. O
Unfortunately, O
he O
developed O
line-associated O
bactermeia O

sepsis O
4 O
weeks O
into O
the O
hospitalization. O
He O
developed O
high O

positive O
for O
MRSA O
that O
had O

on O
ECG O
and O
a O
TTE O
on O
2/10/18 O

with O
evidence O
of O

A O
follow-up O
TEE O
on O
2/17/18 O
showed O
worsening O
aortic O

and O
he O
was O
ultimately O
taken O
to O
the O

by O
Dr. O
Elrod O
on O
2/17/18. O
The O
intraoperative O

and O
he O
underwent O
composite O
aortic O

that O
was O
complicated O
by O
severe O
RV O

he O
had O
recurrent O
malignant O

(VT/VF) O
which O
required O

HE O
was O
taken O
to O
the O

on O
2/22/18. O
His O
course O
was O
subsequently O
notable O
for O

which O
transiently O
required O
CVVH, O
development O
of O
HIT, O

He O
did O
have O
some O

and O
Dr. O
Geiger O
gave O
him O
a O

him. O

CHIEF O
COMPLAINT: O
The O
patient O
is O
a O
75-year-old O
woman, O
new O
patient O
who O
comes O
in O
to O
establish O
primary O
care O
and O
for O
followup O
of O
multiple O
medical O
problems O
including O
end-stage O
renal O
disease, O
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
peripheral O
vascular O
disease, O
history O
of O
foot O
drop, O
etc. O
PAST O
MEDICAL O
HISTORY: O
1. O
End-stage O
renal O
disease. O
Because O
of O
her O
original O
end-stage O
renal O
disease O
was O
reportedly O
FSGS, O
she O
had O
a O
preemptive O
transplant O
in O
2068, O
which O
was O
complicated O
by O
rejection O
and O
ultimate O
loss O
of O
the O
graft. O
She O
resumed O
dialysis O
in O
2072. O
She O
had O
a O
second O
transplant O
in O
2075, O
which O
was O
also O
complicated O
and O
ultimately O
rejected. O
She O
resumed O
hemodialysis O
in O
2082. O
She O
does O
have O
a O
match O
with O
her O
only O
daughter, O
but O
apparently O
the O
Transplant O
Service O
feels O
that O
she O
would O
not O
be O
a O
good O
candidate O
and O
I O
think O
she O
would O
be O
reluctant O
to O
go O
through O
two O
surgeries, O
which O
would O
be O
required, O
one O
to O
remove O
the O
old O
graft O
and O
one O
for O
the O
new O
transplant. O
She O
currently O
is O
dialyzed O
at O
the O
Overbrook O
Hospital. O
Her O
dialysis O
physician O
is O
Dr. O
Lemus. O
2. O
Hypertension. O
3. O
Peripheral O
vascular O
disease. O
She O
had O
an O
angiogram O
in O
2083 O
at O
LMC O
and O
an O
MRA O
in O
2085, O
which O
showed O
bilateral O
iliac O
and O
femoral O
artery O
stenoses. O
She O
apparently O
does O
not O
have O
claudication O
despite O
this. O
4. O
History O
of O
right O
foot-drop. O
She O
had O
a O
severe O
episode O
of O
shingles O
in O
2077 O
with O
associated O
sciatica O
and O
foot-drop. O
5. O
History O
of O
hemorrhoids O
for O
at O
least O
six O
years O
with O
occasional O
bleeding O
and O
with O
anal O
protrusion. O
6. O
History O
of O
CMV O
colitis O
in O
08/2081. O
7. O
Secondary O
hyperparathyroidism. O
She O
is O
on O
Sensipar O
and O
has O
been O
on O
this O
since O
early O
2085. O
PAST O
SURGICAL O
HISTORY: O
She O
had O
a O
supracervical O
hysterectomy O
for O
benign O
disease O
in O
2061 O
and O
a O
left O
salpingo-oophorectomy O
for O
a O
serous O

in O
04/2082. O
She O
is O
status O
post O

She O
is O
status O
post O

Mr. O
Weeks O
for O

of O
coronary CAD
disease, CAD
mitral O

As O
you O
know, O
he O
is O
a O
78-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
underwent O
coronary CAD
artery CAD
bypass CAD
grafting CAD
on CAD
07/20/2096 CAD
and O
had O
two-vessel O
CABG O
at O
that O
time O
with O
a O
LIMA O

and O
a O
saphenous O
vein O
graft O
to O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery. O
Left O
atrial O
appendage O
was O
amputated O
and O
he O
had O
a O

Assessment O
and O
plan: O
In O
summary, O
this O
is O
a O
78-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
grafting, O
closure O
of O
PFO, O
and O
ligation O
of O
the O
left O
atrial O
appendage O
and O
Maze O
procedure O
which O
was O
done O
in O
July O
2096. O
His O
anginal O
equivalent O
prior O
to O
that O
was O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
and O
he O
did O
well O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
but O
now O
has O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
again. O
There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
factors O
involved O
here. O
He O
has O
atrial O
fibrillation O
which O
is O
now O
recurrent O
but O
the O
rate O
seems O
to O
be O
reasonably O
well O
controlled. O
I O
doubt O
that, O
that O
is O
playing O
a O
role O
in O
his O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
He O
also O
has O
a O
history O
of O
plural O
effusions O
which O
could O
have O
been O
contributing O
to O
shortness O
of O
breath O
as O
well O
and O
that O
has O
been O
dealt O
with O
corrosion O
of O
the O
pleura. O
He O
has O
mitral O
regurgitation O
which O
in O
the O
past O
was O
said O
to O
be O
moderate O
and O
he O
has O
had O
the O
closure O
of O
PFO. O
He O
has O
insulin-dependent O
diabetes O
and O
hypertension. O
He O
also O
has O
low O
platelets. O
The O
recurrence O
of O
the O
exertional O
dyspnea O
is O
certainly O
worrisome O
for O
recurrence O
of O
coronary O
disease O
particularly O
with O
the O
exercise O
test O
showing O
anterior O
wall O
ischemia. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
contributing O
to O
this, O
the O
atrial O
fibrillation O
and O
mitral O
regurgitation. O
He O
has O
murmur O
consistent O
with O
mitral O
regurgitation, O
but O
he O
has O
no O
evidence O
of O
decompensated O
congestive O
failure O
at O
this O
time. O
Blood O
pressure O
is O
elevated O
somewhat O
and O
I O
think O
that O
increase O
in O
his O
Avapro O
might O
be O
worthwhile. O
He O
also O
has O
chronic O
renal O
insufficiency O
which O
makes O
things O
more O
complicated O
as O
well. O
My O
feeling O
is O
that O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
recurrence O
of O
coronary O
disease O
and O
I O
spoke O
with O
the O
patient O
about O
this. O
He O
is O
clearly O
limited O
in O
his O
exercise O
capacity O
and O
wants O
to O
have O
something O
done. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
get O
an O
echocardiogram O
to O
be O
sure O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
constrictive O
disease, O
but O
I O
think O
he O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
have O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
get O
the O
echocardiogram, O
bring O
him O
in O
for O
cardiac O
catheterization, O
and O
see O
if O
there O
are O
narrowings O
either O
in O
the O
graft O
or O
in O
his O
native O

Jorgenson O
to O
me O
for O
a O
preoperative O
evaluation O
for O
thyroidectomy O
on O
September O

2071. O
As O
you O

She O
noticed O
a O
nodule O
in O
her O
neck O
in O
April O
or O
May O
of O
this O
year O
and O
brought O
it O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
her O
doctors O
and O
given O
that O
it O
has O
increased O
in O
size, O
it O
is O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
potential O
malignancy O
and O
she O
is O
currently O
scheduled O
to O
undergo O
thyroidectomy O
in O
September O
of O
this O
year. O
In O
terms O
of O
her O
cardiac O
history, O
she O
was O
well O
until O
four O
years O
ago O
when O
she O
developed O
acute O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
was O
admitted O
to O
Lake O
Park O
Hospital O
for O
congestive O
heart O
failure. O
At O
that O
time, O
she O
had O
an O
exercise O
Thallium O
scan O
which O
revealed O
a O
low O
work O
load O
at O
only O
3 O
minutes O
stopping O
secondary O
to O
shortness O
of O
breath O
with O
a O
large O
fixed O
anterolateral O
defect O
and O
a O
dilated O
left O
ventricle. O
In O
addition, O
she O
had O
an O
echo O
in O
June O
of O
2071, O
which O
shows O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
25% O
with O
1+ O
mitral O
regurgitation, O
left O
atrial O

and O
diastolic O

She O
has O
never O
been O
hospitalized O
since O
that O
time O
for O
her O
congestive O
heart O

and O
has O
been O
treated O
medically O
with O

result. O
She O
currently O
denies O
any O
orthopnea, O
PND, O

She O
does O
have O

she O
has O

Issue O
number O
one, O
preoperative O
cardiovascular O
risk O
assessment: O
given O
that O
she O
has O
not O
had O
an O
assessment O
of O
her O
ischemic O
burden O
since O
2067, O
I O
have O
scheduled O
her O
for O
a O
repeat O
exercise O
test O
with O
imaging. O
If O
this O
is O
similar O
to O
her O
previous O
study O
showing O
only O
fixed O
defects O
and O
no O
reversible O
ischemia, O
then O
I O
feel O
that O
she O
will O
be O
of O
low O
to O
moderate O
risk O
for O
surgery O
for O
perioperative O
myocardial O
infarction O
and O
that O
her O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
is O
well O
treated O
and O
therefore, O
will O
not O
preclude O
her O
from O
having O
surgery. O
Issue O
number O
two, O
is O
her O
anticoagulation O
for O
low O
ejection O
fraction. O
She O
is O
currently O
on O
Coumadin O
for O
low O
ejection O
fraction. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know, O
she O
has O
never O
had O
atrial O
fibrillation O
and O
she O
has O
never O
been O
told O
that O
she O
had O
an O
irregular O
rate O
or O
rhythm. O
Therefore, O
I O
recommend O
that O
she O
stop O
her O
Coumadin O
6 O
days O
prior O
to O
surgery O
and O
it O
can O
be O
restarted O
several O
days O
after O
surgery O
without O
Heparin O
overlap O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
the O
surgeons O
as O
to O
how O
may O
days O
she O
should O
wait O
after O
surgery O
before O
restarting O
that O
medication. O
She O
will O
otherwise O
remain O
on O
her O
current O
medical O
regimen O
as O
determined O
by O
her O
cardiologist O
and O
primary O
care O
physician, O
Dr. O
Charles O
Van. O
If O
her O
stress O
test O
is O
without O
reversible O
defects, O
she O
need O
not O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
for O
further O
evaluation. O
Thank O
you O
for O
referring O
this O
interesting O
patient. O

seen O
and O
examined O
with O

Voss. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
visit O
for O
Ms. O
Jorgenson O
who O
is O
a O
64 O
year O
old O
woman O
who O
presents O
for O
management O
of O
papillary O
thyroid O
cancer. O
Her O
symptoms O
began O
in O
May, O
2071, O
when O
she O
felt O
a O
prominence O
in O
her O
neck. O
She O
did O
not O
experience O
any O
dysphagia O
or O
voice O
changes, O
but O
presumably O
was O
felt O
to O
have O
an O
abnormality O
on O
thyroid O
examination. O
She O
underwent O
a O
thyroid O
biopsy O
in O
June, O
2071, O
at O
a O
local O
hospital. O
The O
pathology O
which O
was O
read O
at O
JMH O
revealed O
numerous O
follicular O
cells O
with O
chromatin O
grooves O
suspicious O
for O
papillary O
carcinoma. O
She O
was O
subsequently O
referred O
to O
Dr. O
Geiger O
at O
JMH O
for O
thyroidectomy O
and O
underwent O
thyroidectomy O
on O
9/17/71. O
The O
thyroidectomy O
was O
uncomplicated O
though O
there O
was O
inadvertent O
displacement O
of O
a O
parathyroid O
gland O
and O
this O
gland O
was O
then O
reimplanted. O
According O
to O
the O
operative O
report, O
the O
carcinoma O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
locally O
extensive O
though O
no O
laryngo-tracheal O
nerve O
invasion O
was O
present. O
The O
pathology O
revealed O
a O
(R) O
6 O
cm O
papillary O
carcinoma O
with O
capsular O
and O
lymphovascular O
invasion. O
There O
was O
an O
additional O
focus O
of O
papillary O
carcinoma, O
follicular O
variant, O
in O
the O
(L) O
thyroid O
lobe O
that O
was O
0.3 O
cm. O
Of O
note, O
the O
tissue O
was O
stained O
for O
calcitonin O
and O
this O
was O
negative. O
The O
tumor O
did O
stain O
positively O
for O
thyroglobulin. O
Since O
undergoing O
thyroidectomy, O
Ms. O
Jorgenson O
has O
done O
fairly O
well. O
She O
has O
been O
maintained O
on O
75 O
mcg O
daily O
of O
Levoxyl. O
She O
says O
that O
she O
feels O
generally O
well O
on O
this O
dose O
though O
she O
does O
endorse O
slight O
fatigue. O
She O
denies O
any O
changes O
in O
her O
sleep, O
hair, O

or O
bowels. O
She O
does O
endorse O
a O

though O
several O

were O
in O

Impression:This O
is O
a O
64 O
year O
old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
who O
is O
now O
s/p O
total O
thyroidectomy O
for O
papillary O
thyroid O
cancer. O
Ms. O
Jorgenson O
is O
potentially O
at O
higher O
risk O
for O
recurrence O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
is O
older O
at O
the O
time O
of O
diagnosis, O
she O
had O
a O
large-size O
tumor, O
and O
she O
had O
multifocal O
disease. O
Plan:Check O
a O
TSH O
and O
thyroglobulin O
today O
for O
a O
baseline. O
We O
suspect O
that O
she O
may O
be O
undertreated O
on O
her O
current O
dose O
of O
Levoxyl. O
I O
have O
recommended O
131I O
treatment. O
Benefits O
and O
risks O
were O
discussed. O
In O
addition, O
I O
think O
she O
would O
tolerate O
thyroid O
hormone O
withdrawal. O
TSH O
and O
calcium O
were O
drawn O
today. O
We O
will O
plan O
to O
arrange O
for O
131I O
for O

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
participating O
in O
the O
care O
of O
VivianLee O
Jorgenson O
during O
her O
recent O
hospitalization O
at O
Goulds O
Hospital. O
This O
lovely O
67-year-old O
female O
ended O
up O
having O
no O
discernable O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
on O
catheterization. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
cath, O
her O
pulmonary O
capillary O
wedge O
pressure O
was O
12. O
During O
the O
course O
of O
her O
hospitalization, O
we O
noted O
as O
well O
that O
she O
had O
had O
runs O
of O
nonsustained O
VT O
and O
asked O
our O
EP O
colleagues O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
appropriateness O
of O
an O
ICD. O
They O
felt O
that O
this O
could O
certainly O
be O
rediscussed O
in O
the O
future, O
but O
at O
the O
present O
time, O
there O
was O
no O
compelling O
indication O
for O
her O
to O
receive O
an O
ICD. O
Her O
medications O
at O
discharge O
include O

has O
been O
a O

to O

this O
lovely O

If O
there O
is O
any O

INITIAL O
IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
This O
71-year-old O
female O
presents O
with O
generalized O
weakness O
and O
gait O
instability O
and O
frequent O
falls, O
concerning O
for O
either O
an O
evolving O
intracranial O
process O
such O
as O
a O
subdural O
or O
stroke. O
This O
has O
been O
going O
on O
for O
several O
weeks, O
however, O
but O
also O
presents O
with O
melena O
over O
the O
past O
several O
weeks O
and O
profound O
anemia O
for O
which O
she O
required O
transfusion O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department. O
We O
did O
order O
a O
CT O
of O
the O
brain O
to O
evaluate O
for O
intracranial O
injury O
or O
abnormality O
both O
given O
the O
frequent O
falls O
and O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
falls. O
This O
does O
not O
show O
any O
large O
subdural O
or O
mass O
lesion. O
She O
is O
quite O
anemic O
has O
melanotic O
heme-positive O
stool. O
I O
suspect O
this O
is O
the O
etiology, O
but O
it O
seems O
like O
it O
has O
been O
a O
slow O
progression, O
and O
concerned O
given O
her O
cardiac O
history O
also O
the O
weakness O
and O
could O
represent O
coronary O
insufficiency. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
an O
elevated O
troponin O
at O
present. O
She O
will O
need O
to O
be O
further O
monitored. O
She O
was O
transfused O
here O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
given O
her O
profoundly O
low O
hematocrit O
after O
consent O
was O
obtained. O
Clinically, O
feels O
better. O
I O
discussed O
with O
the O
patient's O

because O
of O
the O

he O
will O
need O
to O
be O
evaluated O
as O
____ O
further O

and O

as O
well O
as O
physical O
therapy O
evaluation O
once O
the O

Jarvis O
is O
quite O
anxious O
about O
it. O
He O
began O
the O
Captopril MEDICATION
and O
HCTZ MEDICATION
(? O
or O
Maxide) O
and O
has O
noted O
good O
blood O
pressure O
control O
as O
checked O
at O
BH. O
At O
first O
he O
developed O
a O
considerable O
cough O
but O
in O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
this O
has O
largely O
resolved. O
He O
states O
that O
the O
cough O
is O
productive O
of O
thick O
phlegm O
and O
may O
reflect O
a O
respiratory O
infection O
rather O
than O
the O
Captopril O
itself. O
His O
blood O
sugars O
when O
checked O
at O
home O
have O
averaged O
between O
the O
140 O
to O
150 O
range O
fasting. O
On O
one O
occasion O
a O
three O
hour O
postprandial O
was O
170. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
attacks O
of O
gout O
or O
gout O
like O
arthritis O
in O
the O
past O
six O
weeks O
and O
is O
quite O
pleased O
about O
this. O
He O
has O
continued O
actively O
managing O
production O
and O
is O
planning O
a O
trip O
to O
Italy O
next O
month. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
examination O
today O
he O
looks O
well O
and O
comfortable. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
is O
140/76 O
right O
arm O
sitting O
with O
regular O
pulse O
of O
68. O
His O
weight O
is O
173 O
(stable). O
IMPRESSION: O
Doing O
reasonably O
well O
on O
the O
new O
blood O
pressure O
program. O
Since O
the O
cough O
is O
resolving O
it O
would O
seem O
reasonable O
to O
continue O
the O
present O
program. O
We O
will O
look O
forward O
to O
seeing O
the O
results O
of O
the O
prostate O
biopsy O
and O
we O
will O
check O
glucose O
and O
glycosylated O
hemoglobin O
today. O
He O
will O
return O
in O
four O
months O
for O
follow O
up. O

Mr O

The O

when O
you O
were O
here O
was O
244 O
and O
the O
average O
calclated O
from O
the O
HbA1c O
is O
171; O
despite O
your O
efforts O
and O
exercise O
and O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
start O
on O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
a O
glucose-lowering O
medicine, O
glipizide MEDICATION
(Glucotrol). O
I O
would O
start O
on O
1/2 O
of O
a O
5 O

pill O
twice O
a O
day O
and O
continue O
checking O
your O
blood O

levels O
from O

to O

If O
they O
stay O
a O
bit O
up, O
then O
increase O
to O
one O
whole O
pill O
(5 O
mg) O
twice O
a O
day. O
Then O
we O
will O
see O
how O
that O
effects O
the O
blood O
sugar. O
I O
don't O
think O
this O
will O
interfere O
with O
your O
trip. O
Call O
me O
in O
a O

to O
tell O
me O
how O
it O
is O
going. O

by O
Dr. O

Mr. O
Jarvis's O
cardiac O
history O
began O
in O
12/95, O
when O
he O
was O
shoveling O
snow. O
At O
that O
time, O
he O
developed O
dizziness, O
diaphoresis O
and O
nausea. O
He O
went O
inside O
and O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
syncope O
which O
lasted O
approximately O
5 O
minutes. O
His O
initial O
EKG O
showed O
1 O
mm O
STE O
in O
II, O
III O
and O
aVF O
and O
1 O
mm O
STE O
in O
V5 O
and O
V6. O
An O
EKG O
seven O
minutes O
later O
showed O
an O
increase O
in O
STE O
in O
the O
inferior O
leads O
and O
STE O
in O
V3 O
to O
V6 O
with O
a O
max O
of O
4 O
mm O
in O
V3. O
He O
never O
developed O
chest O
pain. O
An CAD
emergent CAD
cardiac CAD
catheterization CAD
at CAD
that CAD
time CAD
showed CAD
a CAD
left CAD
main CAD
with CAD
minor CAD
distal CAD
disease. CAD
The O
LAD O
had O
a O
proximal O
80% O
stenosis. O
The O
LCx O
had O
mid O
40% O
diffuse O
disease. O
The O
1st O
OM O
had O
a O
tandem O
lesion O
of O
90%. O
The O
RCA O
was O
large O
and O
dominant O
and O
had O
a O
proximal O
ulcerated O
90% CAD
stenosis CAD
with O
haziness. O
Given O
these O
findings, O
a O
2.5 O
X O
15mm O
BMS O
was O
placed O
into O
the O
proximal O
RCA O
with O
and O
excellent O
result. O
His O
peak O
CK O
was O
305 O
during O
that O
admission. O
An O
echo O
performed O
at O
that O
time O
was O
a O
technically O
difficult O
study, O
which O
showed O
diffuse O
inferior O
hypokinesis. O
He O
was O
discharged O
home O
in O
12/95 O
in O
stable O
condition O
and O
follow-up O
with O
Dr. O
Xaysana O
in O
his O
office O
to O
discuss O
possible O
CABG. O
It O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
should O
have O
a O
repeat O
cardiac O
catheterization O
prior O
to O
the O
CABG O
to O
determine O
whether O
RCA O

is O
present. O
He O
is O
then O
scheduled O
to O
have O
CABG O
with O
Dr. O
Xaysana O
on O
4/23/96. O
The O

recommended. O
On O
the O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
This O
58-year-old O
white O
male O
comes O
to O
the O
office O
for O
followup O
regarding O
his O
recent O
chest O
pain. O
Chest O
pain. O
The O
patient O
was O
in O
his O
usual O
state O
of O
compensated O
health, O
but O
approximately O
one O
month O
ago O
after O
clearing O
significance O
note O
from O
his O
driveway, O
the O
patient O
started O
to O
note O
some O
anterior O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
has O
a O
long CAD

disease CAD
and O
this O
includes O

The O
pain O
did O
not O
radiate O
up O
to O
his O
neck O
or O
arm, O
but O
when O
the O
pain O
persisted O
even O
after O
returning O
from O
Blountstown, O
he O
went O
to O
Roper O
Hospital O
North O
two O
days O
ago O
because O
of O
his O
chest O
discomfort O
to O
see O
his O
cardiologist. O
He O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital, O
had O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization, O
which O
according O
to O
the O
patient O
did O
not O
show O
any O
specific O
lesion. O
The O
doctors O
felt O
that O
he O
did O
not O
have O
a O
myocardial O
infarction, O
but O
that O
in O
fact O
his O
abnormality O
was O
due O
to O
a O
chest O
wall/muscular O
type O
syndrome. O
He O
was O
discharged O
on O
anti-inflammatory O
medicine O
and O
the O
patient O
had O
noted O
that O
when O
he O
took O
the O
aspirin MEDICATION
over O
the O
past O
month, O
his O
discomfort O
was O
improved. O
The O
patient O
states O
that O
he O
had O
the O
chest O
x-rays O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
in O
fact O
also O
had O
a O
CT O
scan, O
which O
did O
not O
show O
any O
pulmonary O
embolism. O
It O
also O
did O
not O
show O
any O
dissecting O
aneurysm O
according O
to O
the O
patient. O
Left O
renal O
lesion. O
As O
part O
of O
his O
routine O
workup, O
the O
patient O
did O
have O
a O
CT O
scan O
and O
this O
identified O
some O
left O
kidney O
mass O
possibly O
on O
this O
scan. O
The O
patient O
denies O
specifically O
any O
flank O
pain O
or O
any O
bleeding O
and O
he O
has O
no O
recent O
weight O
loss. O
I O
spoke O
to O
the O

about O
this O
matter O

Dear O
Dr. O
Barron: O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
kind O
referral O
of O
Frances O
Preston O
to O
the O
Cardiovascular O
Division O
of O
Weston O
General O
Hospital. O
I O
saw O
her O
in O
consultation O
this O
afternoon O
for O
her O
diagnosis O
of O
a CAD
recent CAD
myocardial CAD
infarction. CAD
Please O
allow O
me O
to O
summarize O
her O
history O
for O
our O
records. O
Frances O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
51-year-old O
Danish O
woman O
who O
has O
cardiac O
risk O
factors O
including O
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
hyperlipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
recently O
diagnosed O
glucose O
intolerance. O
It O
appears O
that O
she O
had O
been O
having O
a O
several-month CAD
history CAD
of CAD
anginal-type CAD
symptoms, CAD
although O
a O
stress O
test O
obtained O
in O
March O
showed O
no O
significant O
ischemia. O
On O
04/09/2076 O
she O
was O
in O
New O
York O
helping O
a O
family O
member O
with O
start O
up O
of O
a O
restaurant, O
when O
she O
woke O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
with O
a O
sudden O
onset O
of O
chest O
discomfort O
and O
lightheadedness, O
and O
according O
to O
her O
daughter O
suffered O
a O
cardiac O
arrest. O
She O
was O
taken O
emergently O
to O
Cabrini O
Medical O
Center O
where O
she O
was O
found O
to O
have O
an O
inferior O
wall O
myocardial O
infarction O
and O
underwent O
coronary CAD
stenting. CAD
I O
do O
not O
have O
records O
from O
this O
admission O
that O
she O
does O
have O
her O
stent O
cards O
that O
indicate O
that O
she O
received O
a O
3.5 O
x O
23 O
and O
3.5 O
x O
13 O
Cypher O
drug-eluting O
stents O
to O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery. O
Per O
her O
daughter's O
report, O
she O
had O
a O
significant O
lesion O
in O
another O
blood O
vessel, O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
require O
percutaneous O
coronary O
intervention. O
Unfortunately, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
details O
of O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
coronary O
anatomy. O
Since O
her O
myocardial O
infarction, O
she O
actually O
has O
felt O
quite O
well. O
She O
no O
longer O
has O
the O
angina O
that O
she O
had O
prior O
to O
her O
MI. O
Her O
major O
complaints O
are O
that O
she O
occasionally O
feels O
lightheaded O
and O
somewhat O
fatigued O
but O
overall O
feels O
well. O
She O
is O
able O
to O
walk O
normal O
distances O
without O
cardiac O
symptoms. O
Her O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
notable O
for O
hypertension, O
hyperlipidemia, O
and O
glucose O
intolerance. O
Her O
present O
medications O
include O
aspirin MEDICATION
325 O

and O
has O
three O
children. O
She O
is O
presently O
accompanied O

Landis O
can O
be O
reached O
on O
a O

at O
944-351-0904. O
She SMOKER

Family O
history O
is O
notable O
for O
several O
aunts O
with O
myocardial O
infarctions O
and O
a O
sister O
whose O
has O
had O
a O
prior O
stroke. O
There O
was O
a O
significant O
history O
of O

Review O
of O
Systems: O
Cardiac: O
No O
chest O
pain, O
PND, O
orthopnea, O
dyspnea, O
or O
lower O
extremity O
edema. O
Musculoskeletal: O
No O
myalgias O
or O
arthralgias O
on O
lipid-lowering O
therapy. O
All O
others O
are O
negative. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
she O
is O
an O
overweight O
yet O
well-appearing O
female O
in O
no O
apparent O
distress. O
Her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
131/86 O
and O
her O
heart O
rate O
is O
61 O
beats O
per O
minute. O
Her O
weight O
is O
213 O
pounds. O
Her O
neck O
shows O
2+ O
carotid O
upstrokes. O
There O
is O
a O
hint O
of O
a O
bruit O
in O
the O
left O
carotid. O
The O
carotid O
upstrokes O
are O
full. O
Her O
lungs O
are O
clear O
to O
auscultation. O
The O
heart O
is O
normal O
to O
palpation, O
no O
thrills O
are O
palpated O
and O
the O
PMI O
is O
nondisplaced. O
The O
heart O
is O
regular O
in O
rate O
and O
rhythm O
and O
a O
2/6 O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
is O
heard O
best O
in O
the O
right O
upper O
sternal O
border O
throughout O
the O
precordium. O
The O
abdomen O
is O
obese, OBESE
soft, O
nontender O
with O
normal O
bowel O
sounds. O
Her O
extremities O
show O
no O
edema. O
Her O
EKG O
in O
the O
office O
today O
shows O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
61 O
with O
a O
normal O
axis O
and O
intervals. O
She O
has O
Q O
waves O
and O
T-wave O
inversions O
in O
leads O
III O
and O
F O
consistent O
with O
her O
recent O
myocardial O
infarction. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
a O
recent O
lipid O
profile O
on O
file. O
On O
04/16/2076, O
she O
underwent O
an O
echocardiogram. O
She O
has O
normal O
left O
ventricular O
function O
with O
a O
mild O
intracavitary O
gradient O
of O
9 O
mmHg. O
She O
has O
mild O
aortic O
sclerosis O
with O
a O
velocity O
across O
the O
aortic O
valve O
of O
2.2 O
m/sec. O
There O
are O
no O
significant O
wall O
motion O
abnormalities. O
She O
has O
only O
mild O
mitral O
regurgitation. O
In O
summary, O
well O
we O
do O
not O
have O
records, O
it O
is O
fairly O
clear O
that O
Mrs. O
Preston O
has O
had O
an O
inferior O
wall O
myocardial O
infarction O
treated O
with O
coronary O
stenting. O
She O
did O
receive O
drug-eluting O
stents. O
The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
appears O
that O
her O
left O
ventricular O
function O
is O
very O
well O
preserved O
suggesting O
that O
she O
did O
not O
have O
a O
large O
myocardial O
infarction. O
What O
is O
less O
clear, O
however, O
is O
the O
status O
of O
her O
other O
coronaries, O
there O
is O
some O
suggestion O
that O
she O
may O
have O
significant CAD
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease CAD
at O
this O
time. O
From O
a O
clinical O
standpoint, O
I O
certainly O
do O
not O
think O
that O
she O
requires O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O
at O
this O
time. O
She O
is O
fairly O
asymptomatic, O
and O
is O
doing O
well O
from O
the O
cardiovascular O
standpoint. O
I O
think O
what O
would O
be O
more O
helpful O
in O
guiding O
recommendation O
is O
whether O
she O
has O
significant O
underlying O
ischemia O
at O
this O
point. O
To O
this O
end, O
I O
have O
arranged O
for O
her O
to O
undergo O
an O
adenosine O
PET O
scan O
to O
assess O
for O
residual O
ischemia. O
We O
will O
guide O
our O
recommendations O
regarding O
cardiac O
catheterization O
based O
on O
the O
results O
of O
the O
study. O
In O
terms O
of O
her O
lipids, O
it O
appears O
that O
she O
has O
been O
switched O
to O
Lipitor. MEDICATION
The O
goal O
for O
her O
LDL O
should O
be O
in O
the O
70s O
and O
her O
HDLs O
ideally O
be O
in O
the O
40s. O
In O
terms O
of O
antithrombotic O
therapy, O
she O
did O
receive O
drug-eluting O
stents. O
Therefore, O
she O
should O
certainly O
remain O
on O
aspirin O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
life O
and O
Plavix O
for O
an O
absolute O
minimum O
of O
one O
year. O
After O
a O
year, O
it O
would O
likely O
be O
acceptable O
for O
her O
to O
stop O
her O
Plavix O
for O
brief O
periods O
of O
time O
should O
it O
be O
necessary O
for O
other O
medical O
procedures. O
However, O
up O
until O
that O
time O
her O
Plavix O
should O
not O
be O
discontinued O
without O
a O
discussion O
with O
myself. O
She O
is O
on O
a O
very O
good O
medical O
regimen, O
although O
I O
think O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
a O
beta-blocker. O
The O
hydrochlorothiazide MEDICATION
appears MEDICATION
to MEDICATION
be MEDICATION
a MEDICATION
new MEDICATION
medication MEDICATION
for MEDICATION
her, MEDICATION
and MEDICATION
therefore MEDICATION
I MEDICATION
went MEDICATION
ahead MEDICATION
and MEDICATION
discontinued MEDICATION
this MEDICATION
and O
started MEDICATION
her MEDICATION
on MEDICATION
extended-release MEDICATION
metoprolol MEDICATION
at O
25 O
mg O
a O
day. O
This O
can O
certainly O
be O
cut O
uptitrated O
for O
better O
blood O
pressure O
control. O
I O
will O
call O
her O
daughter O
Landis O
with O
the O
results O
of O
her O
PET O
scan O
and O
further O
recommendations, O
and O
we O
will O
go O
ahead O
and O
make O
plans O
for O
her O
to O
see O
me O
again O
in O
six O
months. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
her O
care. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
further O
questions O
regarding O
her O
management, O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Barron: O
I O
would O
like O
to O
give O
you O
followup O
on O
our O
mutual O
patient O
Frances O
Preston. O
As O
you O
know, O
I O
referred O
her O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
because O
of O
progressive CAD
worsening CAD
angina CAD
and O
a CAD
stress CAD
test CAD
suggesting CAD
anterior CAD
ischemia. CAD
We O
performed O
a O
catheterization CAD
on CAD
12/14/2076. CAD
We CAD
utilized CAD
the CAD
right CAD
radial CAD
artery CAD
for CAD
access. CAD
We CAD
found CAD
that CAD
she CAD
developed CAD
a CAD
significant CAD
in-stent CAD
restenosis CAD
lesion CAD
within CAD
the CAD
previously CAD
placed CAD
Cypher CAD
drug-eluting CAD
stent. CAD
This O
is O
undoubtedly O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
symptoms. O
We O
were O
able O
to O
treat O
this O
lesion O
with O
balloon CAD
angioplasty CAD
and CAD
ultimately CAD
stented CAD
with CAD
a CAD
3.5 CAD
x CAD
24 CAD
Taxus CAD
drug-eluting CAD
stent. CAD
The O
stent O
was O
postdilated O
with O
a O
4 O
mm O
noncompliant O
balloon O
to O
high O
pressure. O
The O
final O
angiographic O
result O
was O
excellent. O
The O
following O
morning O
she O
was O
doing O
quite O
well O
and O
we O
discharged O
her O
later O
in O
the O
day. O
She O
will O
remain O
on O
her O
usual O
medications O
and O
I O
have O
stressed O
the O
importance O
of O
remaining O
on O
aspirin MEDICATION
once O
a O
day O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
life O
and O
Plavix MEDICATION
for O
a O
minimum O
of O
a O
year O
after O
this O
procedure, O
though O
I O
will O
likely O
favor O
indefinite O
therapy. O
I O
plan O
on O
seeing O
her O
again O
on O
01/24/2077 O
in O
followup. O
If O
you O
have O
any O

please O
do O
not O

Dr. O

for O
this O

Patient O
was O
afraid O

was O
told O
by O
the O

that O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
(1) O
Chest O

Certainly O
overdue O

follow-up O
with O
her O
cardiologist, O
Dr. O
Hunter O

slightly O

At O
last O
visit, O
patient O
was O
reluctant O
to O
start O
a O
beta O

Think O
she O
may O
need O
this O
at O
future O

Will O
also O
refer O

her O
cardiologist. O
(3) O
Elevated HYPERLIPIDEMIA

Several O
medications O
that O
patient O
appears O
to O
be O

At O
next O

will O
give O

also O
complained O
of O
more O

states O
in O

that O
she O
has O

for O
her O
lower O
back O

which O
resolved. O
Will O
simply O
follow O

A: O
73 O
yr O
old O
with O

has O
had O
deterioration O
of O
renal O
function O
since O
2095 O
when O
she O
began O
taking O
ACEi O
concomitantly O
with O
NSAID. O
The O
cause O
for O
more O
acute O
deterioration O
of O
renal O
function O
in O
7/2097 O
and O
again O
in O
early O
August O
is O
unclear. O
She O
has O
not O
been O
taking O
any O
NSAID O
including O
OTC O
forms. O
I O
don't O
think O
the O
moderate O
renal O
artery O
stenosis O
is O
a O
significant O
contributor O
to O
renal O
dysfunction O
and O
her O
BP O
is O
reasonable O
off O
the O
ACEi. O
P: O
Her O
daughter O
had O
many O
questions O
about O
what O
this O
type O
of O
'blockage' O
means O
and O
about O
prognosis. O
I O
attempted O
to O
explain O
the O
differences O
between O
renal O
perfusion, O
renal O
function, O
and O
to O
advise O
her O
about O
the O
role/impact O
of O
ACEi O
for O
BP O
and O
her O
heart O
(her O
daughter O
is O
worried O
that O
her O
heart O
will O
suffer O
if O
she O
doesn't O
take O
the O
ACEi). O
I O
told O
her O
that O
it O
is O
unsafe O
for O
her O
to O
take O
any O
NSAID. O
I O
suggested O
that O
a O
renal O
specialist O
would O
be O
helpful O
in O
determining O
the O
role O
of O
renal O
artery O
disease O
in O
her O
renal O
dysfunction. O
Provided O
her O
with O
detailed O
lists O
of O
low O
and O
high O
K+ O
foods. O
Check O

renal O
function, O
Phos, O
Ca O
and O
Alb O
today. O
Will O
discuss O

with O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
The O
patient O
has O
a O
new O
apartment. O
She O
is O
actually O
in O
the O
process O
of O
moving. O
She O
recognizes O
that O
she O
is O
improving, O
and O
is O
very O
excited O
about O
the O
fact O
that, O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
week, O
she O
went O
out O
to O
Sel O
de O
la O
Terre, O
and O
also O
went O
through O
a O
movie O
with O
her O
friend. O
Her O
sugars O
are O
still O
not O
well O
controlled. O
She O
has O
been O
liberalizing O
her O
diet, O
which O
I O
thought O
was O
appropriate. O
I O
did O
increase O
her O
morning O
insulin MEDICATION
to O
20 O
units O
of O
30/70, O
and O
suggested O
that O
she O
change O
from O
five O
units O
of O
NPH MEDICATION
at O
bedtime O
to O
8 O
units O
of O
30-70, O
taken O
with O
her O
supper, O
to O
try O
to O
give O
her O
a O
little O
better O
coverage O
for O
her O
evening O
meal. O
I O
wrote O
a O
note O
to O
the O
nurse O
to O
actuate O
this O
change. O
They O
actually O
called O
me O
later O
in O
the O
evening, O
on O
page, O
and O
I O
discussed O
this O
with O
them, O
at O
length, O
at O
that O
time, O
including O
the O
rationale O
for O
this O
change. O
She O
is O
not O
having O
any O
exertional O
or O
other O
chest O
pain. O
No O
orthopnea, O

or O
peripheral O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
Her O
verbal O
skills O
have O
improved. O
She O
got O
very O
nervous O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
test O
her O
cognitive O
skills, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
give O
me O
the O
days O
of O
the O
week O
forward, O
but O
not O
backwards. O
I O
did O
not O
push O
her O
beyond O
that. O
I O
did O
tell O
her O
that O
we O
would O
need O
to O
check O
her O
TSH O
in O
a O
couple O
weeks' O
time, O
to O
see O
if O
last O

had O
returned O
her O

RE: O

Dear O
Dr. O
You: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
our O
mutual O
patient, O
Mr. O
Jaquante O
Xuereb, O
in O
follow O
up O
evaluation O
in O
our O
vascular O
surgery O
clinic O
here O
at O
the O
Santa O
Rosa O
Infirmary O
today. O
As O
you O
remember, O
he O
recently O
underwent O
a O
revision O
of O
his O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
with O
thrombectomy O
of O
the O
fem-pop O
bypass O
graft O
and O
subsequent O
jump O
graft O
to O
the O
below-knee O
popliteal O
artery. O
He O
returns O
today O
for O
follow O
up O
evaluation. O
He O
has O
a O
warm, O
well-perfused O
foot O
with O
a O
palpable O
dorsalis O
pedis O
pulse. O
Unfortunately, O
over O
the O
last O
ten O
days O
he O
has O
developed O
increased O
erythema O
and O
tenderness O
on O
the O
medial O
aspect O
of O
his O
left O
knee O
with O
superficial O
skin O
breakdown O
consistent O
with O
either O
a O
staph O
or O
a O
strep O
cellulitis. O
He O
had O
been O
on O
a O
course O
of O
p.o. O
antibiotics O
over O
a O
week O
ago O
for O
treatment O
of O
strep O
throat O
as O
well. O
The O
patient O
has O
been O
increased O
his O
activity O
and O
prior O
to O
this O
time O
had O
been O
extremely O
active O
with O
no O
erythema, O
tenderness O
or O
drainage O
from O
his O
leg. O
My O
concern O
is O
that O
he O
has O
increased O
warmth O
with O
blanching O
and O
erythema O
on O
the O
medial O
aspect O
of O
his O
knee O
consistent O
with O
a O
superficial O
cellulitis O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
he O
would O
benefit O
from O
hospital O
admission O
with O
a O
course O
of O
IV O
antibiotics, O
bedrest O
and O
elevate. O
We O
will O
tentatively O
plan O
to O
admit O
him O
for O
localized O
wound O
care O
measures, O
treatment O
with O
IV O
Nafcillin O
on O
a O
q.4 O
hour O
basis. O
In O
addition, O
he O
has O
intact O
femoral O
pulses O
on O
the O
left O
side. O
He O
does O
report O
when O
he O
was O
ambulating O
he O
was O
having O
increased O
difficulty O
with O
claudication O
in O
the O
distal O
left O
lower O
extremity O
and O
calf O
region. O
Most O
recent O
vascular O
lab O
studies O
dated O
November O
29, O
2070 O
reveal O
an O
ABI O
of O
0.96 O
on O
the O
right, O
0.56 O
on O
the O
left. O
I O
will O
keep O
you O
informed O
as O
to O
the O
status O
of O
Mr. O
Xuereb. O
My O
concern O
is O
that O
if O
he O
does O
infect O
this O
PTFE O
graft O
we O
do O
not O
have O
any O
suitable O
autogenous O
conduit O
to O
perform O
an O
additional O
reconstruction O
and O
he O
would O
stand O
a O
very O
high O
chance O
of O
losing O
his O
limb O
at O
the O
knee O
level. O
If O
I O
can O
be O
of O
any O
further O
assistance O
in O
the O
management O
of O
this O
or O
any O
of O

She O

Dear O
Dr. O
Olive, O
Thanks O
for O
asking O
me O
to O
see O
Marion O
Gerald O
who O
I O
saw O
on O
May O
18. O
She O
is O
referred O
for O
either O
fibromyalgia O
or O
polymyalgia. O
The O
patient O
states O
she O
is O
currently O
60 O
but O
was O
in O
her O
usual O
state O
of O
good O
health O
until O
2065 O
when O
she O
developed O
diffuse O
chest O
wall O
pain O
and O
tingling. O
This O
continued O
to O
bother O
her O
and O
she O
eventually O
was O
treated O
with O
steroids. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
she O
had O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
PMR O
or O
fibromyalgia. O
She O
then O
was O
switched O
to O
ibuprofen O
which O
did O
not O
work O
particularly O
well. O
Over O
this O
time, O
she O
would O
have O
intermittent O
episodes O
with O
nocturnal O
discomfort O
and O
most O
recently O
has O
increasing O
pain O
in O
her O
palms, O
back, O
neck, O
low O
back, O
legs, O
and O
into O
her O
arms. O
She O
was O
seen O
by O
Dr. O
Zink O
at O
Barr O
Clinic, O
and O
no O
blood O
studies O
were O
obtained, O
but O
she O
states O
she O
had O
'25 O
shots' O
of O
steroids. O
She O
denies O
any O
hot O
or O
swollen O
joints. O
She O
has O
had O
occasional O
arm O
swelling O
but O
this O
has O
resolved. O
Extensive O
ROS O
reveals O
no O
photosensitivity O
but O
she O
does O
have O
some O
oral O
ulcers O
and O
Raynaud's. O
She O
has O
urgency O
regarding O
her O
bladder O
and O
has O
been O
evaluated O
but O
not O
particularly O
well. O
She O
has O
continued O
to O
be O
concerned O
about O
that. O
She O
has O
had O
fevers O
or O
chills O
but O
no O
temperature O
elevation. O
She O
has O
intermittent O
abdominal O
pain O
but O
has O
had O
a O
colonoscopy O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
was O
evaluated O
for O
this. O
She O
has O
morning O
stiffness O
of O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
nocturnal O
pain O
through O
the O
night. O
Family O
history O
is O
otherwise O
remarkable O
for O
diabetes DIABETES
in O
her O
father. O
Mother O
is O
85. O
Two O
sons O

for O
above. O
She O
has O
had O
a O

her O

The O

an O

on CAD
10/07/83 CAD
and O
comes O
in O
today O
having O
just O
had O

Immediately O
after O
exercise, O
she O
did O
have O
some O
substernal O
chest O
pain, O
resolved O
3 O
minutes O
into O
recovery. O
There O
were O
no O
EKG O

The O
patient O
reports O
that O
she O
has O

and O
does O
not O
have O
any O
chest O

with O

which O
had O
precipitated O
the O

initially. O
She O
is O
looking O
into O

but O
is O
not O
sure O
that O
she O
needs O

do O
this. O
She O

only O
in O
the O
morning. O
Evening O
blood O
sugars O
are O
mostly O
in O
90s O
to O

100s. O
However, O
at O
times O
during O
the O
day, O
she O
feels O
hypoglycemically O
sweating O
and O
abdominal O
discomfort. O
She O
has O
never O
actually O
checked O
her O

during O
these O

IMPRESSION: O

Also O
notable O
in O

is O
notable O
for O

Patient O
was O
in O
her O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
until O
3 O
days O
prior O
to O
admission, O
when O
she O
began O
experiencing O
unremitting O
substernal O
chest O
pain, O
nonradiating. O
This O
pain O
was O
constant, O
24 O
hours/day O
, O
and O
felt O
like O
a O
herd O
of O
elephants O
on O
my O
chest. O
This O
was O
accompanied O
by O
an O
increased O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
especially O
with O
exertion, O
which O
the O
patient O
had O
not O
experienced O
before. O
The O
chest O
pain O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath O
would O
wake O
her O
up O
at O
night, O
accompanied O
by O
drenching O

and O
a O
dizziness, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
about O

faint. O
Patient O
sleeps O
with O
two O

at O

The O
pain O
eventually O
grew O
to O
be O
so O
severe O
that O
the O

called O

Upon O
their O
arrival O
at O

which O
improved O

Based O
on O
these O

This O
constellation O
of O

may O
be O
viewed O
in O
several O
different O
ways: O
from O
a O
cardiac O
standpoint, O
as O

and O

believe O
the O
priority O

be O

HISTORY: O
Mr. O
Meyar O
is O
a O
delightful O
patient O
referred O
to O
me O
by O
Dr. O
Osiel O
Mckee. O
His O
PSA O
in O
2093 O
was O
3.8, O
early O
this O
year O
6.3, O
and O
on O
repeat O
7.1. O
Abnormality O
was O
noted O
on O
digital O
rectal O
exam. O
He O
has O
very O
little O
in O
the O
way O
of O
voiding O
symptoms O
with O
a O
good O
stream, O
no O
dribbling, O
nor O
any O
frequency. O
He O
does O
still O
have O
his O
erections, O
though O
they O
are O
not O
as O
good O
as O
they O
used O
to O
be. O
The O
erections O
are O
still O
an O
important O
issue O
with O
him. O
Dr. O
Mckee O
performed O
a O
transrectal O
ultrasound O
that O
showed O
a O
13 O
cc O
prostate. O
He O
took O
12 O
biopsy O
cores O
and O
all O
12 O
demonstrated O
prostate O
cancer. O
In O
4 O
it O
was O
Gleason O
6 O
and O
in O
the O
remainder O
Gleason O
7. O
Many O
cores O
had O
a O
predominant O
Gleason O
4 O
pattern. O
Many O
of O
the O
cores O
were O
heavily O
involved O
with O
40% O
involvement O
or O
more. O
Mr. O

The O

is O
taken O
up O
with O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
Mr. O
Meyer O
is O
a O
young O
man O
with O
a O
significant O
and O
quite O
bulky O
prostate O
cancer. O
I O
certainly O
do O
not O
think O
active O
surveillance O
is O
an O
option O
for O
him, O
which O
is O
a O
shame, O
as O
that O
was O
his O
preference. O
Left O
untreated, O
I O
think O
he O
will O
be O
in O
deep O
trouble O
at O
some O
stage O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years. O
His O
second O
choice O
for O
treatment O
is O
prostate O
brachytherapy O
but O
again O
I O
believe O
his O
disease O
is O
too O
extensive O
for O
this O
and O
brachytherapy O
would O
represent O
significant O
under O
treatment. O
On O
balance, O
my O
preference O
for O
him O
is O
either O
to O
have O
a O
radical O
prostatectomy, O
perhaps O
followed O
by O
postoperative O
radiation O
or O
alternatively, O
if O
he O
wishes O
to O
avoid O
surgery O
and O
he O
does, O
for O
him O
to O
have O
high-dose O
external O
radiation O
in O
conjunction O
with O
neoadjuvant O
and O
concomitant O
androgen O
deprivation. O
While O
I O
think O
he O
will O
recover O
good O
voiding O
function O
after O
either O
of O
these O
treatment O
combinations O
his O
sex O
life O
is O
under O
threat O
and O
he O
is O
aware O
of O
this. O
We O
will O
defer O
the O
final O
decision O
next O
week O
until O
he O
has O
had O
his O
scans. O
Obviously, O
should O
they O
show O
extensive O
extracapsular O
disease O
then O
surgery O
will O
be O
off O
the O
table, O
if O
they O
show O
nodal O
disease O
the O
same O
is O
true O
and O
we O
will O
be O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
long-term O
androgen O
deprivation. O
Hopefully O
neither O
of O
these O
scenarios O
will O
occur. O

CONCISE O
HISTORY: O
Mr. O
Meyer O
is O
a O
63 O
year O
old O
man O
who O
was O
found O
to O
have O
an O
elevated O
PSA O
of O
7.1 O
on O
screening O
exam. O
An O
abnormality O
was O
also O
noted O
on O
DRE O
at O
that O
time. O
Prostate O
biopsy O
was O
performed, O
and O
all O
12 O
cores O
were O
positive O
for O
disease, O
including O
8 O
cores O
with O
Gleason O
7 O
disease. O
Prostatic O
MRI O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
extracapsular O
extension. O
CT O
of O
the O
abdomen O
and O
bone O
scan O
revealed O
no O
evidence O
of O
metastatic O
disease. O
He O
was O
treated O
with O
definitive O
radiation O
to O
the O
prostate O
and O
seminal O
vesicles O
by O
IMRT, O
with O
concomitant O
Zoladex O
treatment. O
SPECIAL O
TECHNICAL O
CONSIDERATIONS: O
The O
patient O
underwent O
CT-based O
imaging O
to O
define O
the O
target O
volume O
and O
the O
normal O
tissue O
structures O
and O
3D O
treatment O
planning O
was O
performed O
for O
treatment O
with O
IMRT. O
Daily O
localization O
of O
the O
prostate O
was O
done O
using O
the O
BAT O
ultrasound. O
SUMMARY O
OF O
RADIATION O
AND O
TREATMENT O
ADMINISTERED: O
The O
treatment O
site O
was O
the O
prostate O
gland O
plus O
the O
caudal O
seminal O
vesicles O
followed O
by O
a O
boost O
to O
the O
prostate O
alone. O
The O
patient O
underwent O
external O
beam O
radiotherapy O
to O
the O
prostate O
and O
caudal O
seminal O
vesicles O
to O
a O
dose O
of O
45 O
Gy O
given O
as O
25 O
fractions O
of O
1.8 O
Gy/day. O
He O
then O
underwent O
a O
boost O
to O
the O
prostate O
only O
of O
34. O
Gy O
given O
in O
17 O
fractions O
of O
2 O
Gy/day O
for O
a O
total O
dose O
of O
79 O
Gy. O
CLINICAL O
COURSE: O
The O
patient O
developed O
mild O
nocturia O
and O
more O
frequent O
bowel O
movements, O
for O
which O
he O
took O
Flomax O
and O
Metamucil. O
Mr. O
Meyer O
has O
tolerated O
his O
androgen O
deprivation O
therapy O
well. O
FOLLOW-UP: O
Mr. O
Meyer O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
us O
in O
3 O

Dear O
Dr. O
Shirley: O
Thank O
you O
for O
referring O
Irene O
Yarbrough O
for O
evaluation O
of O
her O
atrial O
fibrillation. O
Mrs. O
Yarbrough O
is O
55 O
years O
old. O
Over O
the O
past O
year O
she O
had O
had O
menorrhagia O
and O
underwent O
endometrial O
biopsy O
in O
September O
of O
2078 O
followed O
by O
total O
abdominal O
hysterectomy O
in O
early O
October O
of O
2078. O
Her O
post-operative O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
a O
pelvic O
abscess O
for O
which O
she O
was O
rehospitalized O
in O
late O
October O
and O
during O
that O
hospitalization O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
which O
reverted O
spontaneously O
to O
sinus O
rhythm. O
The O
episode O
was O
accompanied O
by O
some O
substernal O
chest O
heaviness O
but O
no O
other O
symptoms O
and O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
of O
any O

She O
was O
placed O
on O
verapamil MEDICATION
240 O

daily O
and O
has O
not O
had O
any O
symptomatic O
recurrences. O
Her O
abdominal O
incision O
is O
open O
but O
healing O
and O
she O
has O
been O
recovering O
well. O
She O
has O
no O
prior O
cardiac O
history. O
She O
specifically O
denies O
any O
exertional O
chest O
pain, O
palpitations, O
or O
transient O
neurologic O
symptoms. O
She O
can O
climb O
a O
flight O
of O
stairs O
at O
her O
own O
pace O
but O
is O
mildly O
dyspneic O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stairs. O
She O
feels O
that O
her O
exertional O
capacity O
has O
increased O
somewhat O
over O
the O
past SMOKER

a SMOKER

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENTING O
COMPLAINT: O
This O
patient O
was O
seen O
with O
Dr. O
Nettles, O
Emergency O
Medicine O
resident. O
The O
Chief O
Complaint, O
History O
of O
Present O
Illness, O
Past O
Medical O
History, O
Medications, O
Allergies, O
Social O
History, O
Family O
History O
and O
Review O
of O
Systems O
are O
as O
noted O
by O
Dr. O
Nettles O
on O
the O
record O
and O
were O
reviewed O
with O
him O
and O
with O
the O
patient. O
Briefly, O
this O
is O
a O
55 O
year O
old O
woman O
who O
presented O
with O
chest O
pain O
which O
was O
epigastric O
and O
substernal O
in O
nature, O
essentially O
sharp O
and O
non-radiating O
that O
had O
come O
on O
at O
rest. O
She O
has O
several O
cardiac O
risk O
factors O
including O
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
obesity OBESE
and O
hormone O
replacement O
but O
had O
no O
specific O
cardiac O
history. O
Her O
symptoms O
did O
not O
resolve O
with O
Mylanta. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
As O
noted O
by O
Dr. O
Nettles O
and O
is O
most O
noteworthy O
for O
normal O
heart O
sounds, O
although O
she O
does O
have O
a O
II/VI O
systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
at O
the O
apex O
(the O
upper O
right O
sternal O
border). O
LABORATORY O
EVALUATION: O
An O
electrocardiogram O
does O
not O
show O
acute O
changes O
but O
does O
have O
T O
wave O
inversions O
in O
V1 O
to O
V3. O
These O
were O
previously O
noted O
in O
10/78. O
THERAPY O
RENDERED/COURSE O
IN O
ED: O
The O
patient O
required O
nitroglycerine MEDICATION
and O
nitroglycerine, O
IV O
nitroglycerine O
and O
IV O
heparin O
with O
some O
morphine O
to O
relieve O
her O
pain. O
She O
also O
received O
Lopressor MEDICATION
25 O
mg O
IV O
and O
was O
given O
some O
GI O
meds. O
She O
eventually O
became O
pain-free, O
although O
she O
does O
admit O
to O
a O
residual O
mild O
discomfort O
in O
her O
chest. O
There O
are O
no O
electrocardiographic O
changes. O
IMPRESSION: O
I O
concur O
with O
Dr. O
Nettles O
that O
this O
patient O
has O
chest O
pain O
suspicious O
for O
unstable CAD
angina. CAD
She O
has O
responded O
well O
to O
aggressive O
treatment O
of O
this O
and O
she O
will O
be O
admitted O
for O
further O
evaluation. O
FINAL O
DIAGNOSIS: O
Chest O
pain. O
DISPOSITION O
(including O
condition O
upon O
discharge): O
Admission. O
Condition O
satisfactory. O

DIAGNOSIS: O
Bilateral O
hand O
numbness O
and O
pain, O
recurrent O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome. O
SUBJECTIVE: O
The O
patient O
is O
a O
54-year-old O
right-hand O
dominant O
male O
with O
multiple O
medical O
problems O
including O
diabetes DIABETES
mellitus DIABETES
and O
renal O
failure O
requiring O
hemodialysis, O
who O
was O
has O
had O
bilateral O
hand O
numbness O
for O
several O
years, O
but O
getting O
worse O
within O
the O
last O
year O
or O
so. O
The O
patient O
states O
that O
he O
has O
had O
past O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
and O
trigger O
finger O
release O
of O
the O
bilateral O
hand O
and O
the O
symptoms O
that O
he O
is O
feeling O
now O
is O
somewhat O
similar O
2-10 O
years O
ago O
appearance O
of O
symptoms. O
PAST O
MEDICAL O
HISTORY: O
Hypertension, HYPERTENSION
diabetes O
mellitus, O
and O
chronic O
renal O
failure. O
PAST O
SURGICAL O
HISTORY: O
Bilateral O
eye O
surgeries, O
right O
shoulder O
surgeries, O
and O
bilateral O
carpal O
tunnel O
surgery O
as O
mentioned O
above. O
CURRENT O
MEDICATIONS: O
Multiple O
antibiotics O
including O
isoniazid, O
doxycycline, O
insulin, MEDICATION
Cardura, O
Glucophage, MEDICATION
Elavil, O
and O
Biaxin. O
Please O
note O
that O
the O
patient O
is O
hepatitis O
C O
positive O
and O
hepatitis O
B O
positive. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
today O
s O
examination, O
the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
a O
fairly O
long O
carpal O
tunnel O
scar O
on O
bilateral O
hands O
extending O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
volar O
wrist O
level. O
Long O
finger O
and O
right O
index O
finger O
scar O
at O
the O
base O
at O
the O
MP O
joint O
level O
is O
noted, O
the O
fourth O
trigger O
release, O
which O
was O
performed O
in O
2062 O
as O
well. O
The O
patient O
has O
rather O
stiff O
fingers O
overall O
with O
inability O
to O
fully O
flex O
the O
fingers O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
thumb O
space. O
There O
is O
no O
locking O
or O
triggering, O
but O
fairly O
extensive O
stiffness O
involving O
the O
flexor O
tendon O
was O
noted. O
Durkan O
s O
test O
was O
positive O
and O
Phalen O
s O
test O
was O
positive O
as O
well. O
However, O
abductor O
pollicis O
brevis O
function O
is O
intact. O
Other O
examination O
demonstrated O
some O
noticeable O
decrease O
in O
size O
of O
the O
muscle O
with O
some O
prominence O
of O
the O
vasculature O
on O
the O
radial O
side O
of O
the O
left O
hand, O
but O
otherwise O
normal O
examination. O
IMPRESSION: O
As O
above. O
PLAN: O
My O
recommendation O
is O
that O
patient O
undergo O
very O
vigorous O
assessment O
for O
the O
median O
nerve O
function. O
In O
addition O
to O
this, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
actually O
consider O
providing O
him O
with O
the O
stretching O
exercises O
and O
flexion O
exercises O
as O
well O
as O
passive O
range O
of O
motion O
of O
the O
fingers. O
It O
may O
be O
a O
little O
to O
early O
to O
consider O
this O
option O
until O
he O
returns O
with O
the O
result O
of O
EMG O
nerve O
conduction O
study. O

Dear O
Bethany: O
I O
saw O
your O
patient, O
Fay O
Foust, O
in O
my O
office O
today. O
Mrs. O
Foust O
is O
a O
65-year-old O
woman O
who O
is O
feeling O
significantly O
improved, O
but O
who O
complains O
of O
dizziness O
after O
she O
takes O
her O
medications. O
Her O
history O
of O
severe O
hypertension, O
without O
definite O
secondary O
causes, O
only O
a O
mild O
left O
renal O
artery O
stenosis, O
a O
recent O
admission O
for O
chest O
discomfort O
and O
hypertension, O
with O
a O
CTA O
that O
disclosed O
only O
modest O
plaques O
in O
her O
3 O
major O
coronary O
arteries, O
treated O
dyslipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
type DIABETES
II DIABETES
diabetes, DIABETES
and O
vigorous O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
function O
and O
significant O
left O
ventricular O
hypertrophy, O
is O
detailed O
above. O
Ms. O
Foust O
feels O
that O
her O
life O
has O
been O
brought O
back O
to O
her. O
She O
takes O
her O
amlodipine, MEDICATION
lisinopril, MEDICATION
and O
carvedilol O
at O
8:30 O
a.m. O
Thirty O
minutes O
later, O
she O
states O
that O
she O
feels O
lightheaded O
and O
her O
blood O
pressure O
can O
be O
in O
the O
100/70 O
mmHg O
range O
to O
120/80 O
mmHg O
range. O
She O
believes O
that O
her O
heart O
rate O
is O
approximately O
60 O
beats O
per O
minute O
at O
those O
times. O
After O
1-2 O
hours, O
she O
starts O
to O
feel O
improved. O
At O
8:30 O
p.m., O
when O
she O
takes O
only O
her O
carvedilol O
and O
amlodipine, O
again, O
she O
has O
similar O
symptoms. O
When O
she O
has O
the O
symptoms, O
she O
sometimes O
also O
notices O
a O
discomfort O
in O
her O
low O
back. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
dyspnea O
and O
she O
has O
only O
rare O
episodes O
of O
mild O
chest O
heaviness. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
palpitations. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
actual O
lower O
extremity O
swelling, O
though O
she O
feels O
that O
after O
her O
metformin, O
her O
legs O
can O
feel O
heavy. O
She O
is O
not O
having O
an O
alteration O
in O
gastrointestinal O
or O
genitourinary O
habits. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
musculoskeletal O
achiness, O
aside O
from O
the O
low O
back O
discomfort O
described. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
any O
peripheral O
numbness. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
review O
of O
systems O
is O
unremarkable. O
The O
present O

simvastatin O

and O
metformin O

On O
examination, O
the O
weight O
is O
110 O
pounds, O
decreased O
3 O
pounds O
compared O
to O
01/96. O
The O
blood O
pressure O
was O
initially O
136/60 O
mmHg O
with O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
60 O
beats O
per O
minute, O
respiratory O
rate O
12, O
and O
she O
was O
complaining O
of O
low O
back O
discomfort, O
and O
she O
was O
very O
slightly O
lightheaded. O
Later, O
the O
blood HYPERTENSION
pressure HYPERTENSION
was HYPERTENSION
160/70 HYPERTENSION
mmHg HYPERTENSION
and HYPERTENSION
she O
stated O
that O
her O
blood O
pressure O
has O
not O
been O
so O
high O
for O
the O
last O
several O
weeks. O
She O
was O
still O
complaining O
of O
slightly O
dizziness O
and O
low O
back O
discomfort. O
The O
skin O
is O
warm O
and O
dry O
and O
she O
looks O
quite O
calm. O
She O
is O
fully O
alert. O
The O
neck O
veins O
are O
not O
elevated. O
The O
carotid O
upstrokes O
are O
brisk O
and O
the O
volumes O
are O
normal. O
There O
are O
no O
carotid O
bruits O
though O
there O
was O
a O
transmitted O
murmur. O
The O
lungs O
are O
clear. O
The O
PMI O
is O
not O
displaced. O
There O
is O
a O
normal-sounding O
S1 O
and O
a O
physiologically O
split O
S2, O
with O
a O
soft, O
2/6 O
early-peaking O
systolic O
murmur O
across O
the O
aortic O
valve O
that O
decreases O
with O
Valsalva. O
The O
abdomen O
is O
benign. O
There O
is O
no O
renal O
artery O
bruit. O
The O
distal O
pulses O
remain O
excellent O
and O
there O
is O
no O
pedal O
edema. O
There O
is O
no O
tenderness O
of O
her O
skin. O
The O
resting O
electrocardiogram O
shows O
a O
sinus O
bradycardia O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
56 O
beats O
per O
minute, O
intervals O
of O
0.20/0.08/0.40, O
45-degree O
axis, O
very O
slight O
inferolateral O
ST O
segment O
flattening. O
Impression: O
Mrs. O
Foust O
is O
feeling O
much-improved. O
The O
dizziness O
and O
low O
back O
discomfort O
that O
she O
describes O
could O
possibly O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
drop O
in O
blood O
pressure O
to O
170 O
mmHg, O
with O
mild O
hypoperfusion O
of O
her O
spinal O
arteries, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
head. O
However, O
today O
she O
had O
dizziness O
even O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
160 O
mmHg. O
Though O
we O
could O
be O
tempted O
to O
juggle O
with O
her O
regimen O
and O
reduce O
her O
amlodipine O
slightly, O
or O
change O
the O
times O
when O
she O
takes O
the O
medications, O
I O
think O
that O
we O
are O
facing O
some O
difficulties O
only O
related O
to O
the O
poor O
autoregulation O
of O
her O
cerebral O
and O
peripheral O
vessels. O
I O
think O
that O
we O
should O
continue O
her O
on O
her O
present O
regimen. O
Gradually, O
we O
would O
expect O
her O
symptoms, O
related O
to O
changes O
in O
blood O
pressure, O
to O
improve O
as O
her O
vessel O
elasticity O
improves. O
I O
think O
that O
we O
can O
be O
satisfied O
that O
she O
is O
not O
becoming O
too O
bradycardic. O
We O
are O
pleased O
with O
the O
present O
regimen. O
We O
have O
never O
been O
absolutely O
certain O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
tiny O
penetrating O
aortic O
ulcer O
for O
her O
discomforts O
or O
so O
dramatic, O
but O
the O
treatment O
would O
be O
precisely O
as O
it O
is O
now. O
We O
were O
not O
surprised O
by O
her O
CTA O
and O
her O
treatment, O
naturally, O
remains O
unchanged. O
I O
think O
that O
we O
want O
her O
to O
continue O
her O
metformin, O
and O
we O
may O
have O
to O
consider O
increasing O
it O
to O
at O
least O
twice O
daily, O
depending O
on O
followup O
A1c O
values. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O
Mrs. O
Foust's O
care. O
I O
know O
that O
you O
will O
continue O
to O
follow O
her O
closely. O
I O
told O
her O
that O
I O
would O
see O
her O
again O
in O
nine O
months. O
Sincerely, O

who O
presents O
with O
one O
episode O
of O
syncope. O
1. O
Syncope: O
Most O
likely O
etiology O
of O
his O
syncopal O
episode O
is O
vasovagal/ O
neurocardiogenic, O
considering O
the O
presence O
of O
prodromal O
symptoms O
(sweating, O
feeling O
warm) O
5 O
minutes O
before O
the O
event. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
patient O
has O
been O
dehydrated, O
considering O
the O
last O
couple O
days O
have O
been O
very O
humid, O
and O
he O
hasn't O
changed O
his O
fluid O
intake. O
However, O
the O
sudden O
onset O
of O
his O
syncope O
and O
LOC O
for O
1-2 O
minutes O
concerning O
for O
cardiogenic O
causes O
as O
well: O
including O
sinus O
brady O
and O
other O
arrhythmic O
events. O
Ischemic O
event O
is O
less O
likely O
in O
this O
man. O
EKG O
showed O
no O
significant O
changes O
compared O
to O
the O
previous O
one, O
and O
he O
has O
known O
MR O
evidenced O
on O
his O
TTE O
in O
2090. O
Other O
possible O
causes O
include: O
Neurologic: O
unlikely O
with O
no O
focal O
neuro O
symptoms O
both O
witnessed O
at O
the O
time O
and O
currently. O
However, O

possibilities O
include O

a O

who O
presents O
with O
an O
episode O
of O
profuse O
diaphoresis O
and O
generalized O
weakness O
while O
cooking O
in O
his O
home O
at O
10am O
this O
morning. O
He O
had O
recently O
returned O
home O
from O
grocery O
shopping, O
carrying O
6 O
bags O
of O
groceries O
up O
1 O
flight O
to O
his O
apartment, O
and O
was O
moving O
about O
his O
kitchen O
cooking O
when O
he O
felt O
suddenly O
drenched O
in O
sweat. O
He O
immediately O
felt O
lightheaded, O
disoriented, O
nauseous, O
generally O
weak, O
and O
as O
though O
he O
was O
about O
to O
faint. O
He O
was O
able O
to O
walk O
a O
few O
steps, O
sit O
down, O
and O
rest O
for O
15-20min O
before O
he O
realized O
his O
symptoms O
weren't O
resolving, O
called O
his O
sister, O
and O
put O
his O
head O
on O
the O
table O
and O
felt O
he O
could O
not O
really O
move O
because O
he O
was O
so O
weak. O
He O
denied O
any O
CP, O
SOB, O
palpitations, O
flushes, O
fever/chills, O
HA, O
visual O
changes, O
vomiting, O
and O
focal O
weakness O
associated O
with O
the O
episode. O
He O
felt O
he O
had O
been O
drinking O
adequate O
fluids, O
had O
no O
recent O
infections/cough/rhinorrhea, O
had O
no O
weight O
loss, O
and O
no O
exposures. O
When O
his O
sister O
arrived O
he O
told O
her O
to O
call O
911, O
and O
soon O
he O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
SOH O
ED. O
One O
month O
PTA, O
Mr. O
Crawford O
had O
been O
in O
his O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
when O
he O
had O
his O
first O
ever O
feeling O
of O
lightheadedness O
and O
diaphoresis O
while O
grocery O
shopping. O
Five O
minutes O
later O
while O
getting O
into O
his O
car, O
he O
had O
increasing O
lightheadedness O
and O
lost O
consciousness, O
falling O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
no O
head O
trauma. O
As O
with O
today's O
episode, O
he O
denied O
prior O
CP, O
SOB, O
palpitations O
and O
other O
symptoms O
previously O
listed. O
According O
to O
his O
sisters O
who O
were O
present O
at O
the O
time, O
he O
regained O
consciousness O
2 O
minutes O
later, O
and O
he O
recalls O
knowing O
exactly O
where O
he O
was O
but O
not O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
him. O
He O
did O
not O
lose O
continence O
of O
bladder O
or O
bowel. O
He O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
ED, O
where O
his O
vitals O
were O
stable O
with O
a O
BP O
of O
126/61 O
and O
HR O
66, O
and O
was O
admitted O
for O
observation O
and O
workup. O
Head O
CT O
was O
negative O
for O
an O
acute O
process, O
CXR O
was O
clear, O
EKG O
showed O
some O
LA O
enlargement O
and O
mild O
ST O
/ O
Twave O
changes O
consistent O
with O
an O
EKG O
of O
2yrs O
ago, O
negative O
cardiac O
enzymes, O
and O
a O
cardiac O
echo O
showing O
mild O
MR, O
an O
elongated O
LA, O
and O
an O
EF O
of O
68%. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
he O
was O
instructed O
to O
stop O
taking O
Prazosin O
for O
his O
BPH O
and O
instead O
take O
Flomax. O
In O
the O
past O
month, O
Mr. O
Crawford O
has O
had O
no O
repeat O
syncopal O
episodes, O
but O
many O
episodes O
of O
diaphoresis O
with O
very O
mild O
lightheadedness. O
He O
reports O
that O
at O
least O
every O
few O
days O
he O
either O
has O
a O
brief O
diaphoresis O
episode O
during O
his O
daily O
activities, O
or O
sometimes O
a O
profuse O
diaphoresis O
that O
can O
occur O
while O
lying O
in O
bed O
and O
causing O
him O
to O
change O
his O
clothes O
and O
bedsheets. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
other O
symptoms. O
Of O
note, O
this O
morning O
he O
had O
run O
out O
of O
Flomax O
due O
to O
an O
insurance O
issue, O
and O
resumed O
taking O
4mg O
of O
leftover O
Prazosin O
for O
his O
BPH O
around O
6am. O
He O
disliked O
the O
Flomax O
because O
it O
seemed O
to O
cause O
polyuria O
and O
generally O
made O
him O
feel O
'off' O
in O
an O
unidentifiable O
way. O
Currently O
the O
pt O
feels O
slightly O
lightheaded/'woozy', O
sometimes O
worse O
with O
positional O
changes, O
and O
still O
generally O
weak, O
with O
no O
other O
symptoms. O

who O

as O

as O

Certainly O
in O
someone O
with O
known O
CAD, O
cardiogenic O
near-syncope O
is O
most O
concerning, O
namely, O
MI, O
with O
atypical O

However, O
his O
EKG O
is O
unchanged, O
his O
troponins O
are O
negative, O
and O
he O
never O
had O
chest O
pain. O
Perhaps O
his O
light-headedness O
is O
secondary O
to O
bradycardia, O
as O
his O
heart O
rate O
has O
been O
in O
the O
50s O

60s. O
However, O
I O
think O
the O
most O
likely O
explanation O
is O
that O
he O
has O
a O

of O
gastroenteritis, O
was O

had O
a O

History O
of O
Present O
Illness: O
Mr. O
Sherman O
is O
a O
patient O
well O
known O
to O
me. O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
on O
multiple O
occasions O
for O
his O
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease, CAD
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
and O
diabetes. DIABETES
The O
patient O
has O
had O
a O
positive CAD
exercise CAD
tolerance CAD
test CAD
recently CAD
and O
was O
seen O
by O
Cardiology O
who O
felt O
that O
he O
should O
undergo O
cardiac O
catheterization. O
However, O
patient O
was O
overweight O
and O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
for O
him O
to O
reduce O
his O
weight O
by O
approximately O
50 O
lb. O
at O
which O
time O
he O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
cardiac O
catheterization O
on O
the O
Pontiac O
equipment. O
Patient O
was O
seen O
last O
night O
in O
the O
Pontiac O
Emergency O
Room O
with O
a O
several O
day O
history O
of O
back O
pain O
which O
began O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
his O
back O
and O
has O
subsequently O
become O
right O
flank O
pain O
which O
is O
persistent O
and O
colicky O
in O
nature. O
On O
exam O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
he O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
afebrile. O
His O
exam O
was O
notable O
for O
CVA O
tenderness O
and O
an O
exam O
highly O
suspicious O
of O
renal O
colic. O
His O
EKG O
was O
unremarkable O
and O
his O
laboratory O
exam O
was O
unremarkable O
as O
well. O
His O
urinalysis O
did O
not O
demonstrate O
any O
red O
blood O
cells, O
however, O
did O
have O
3+ O
uric O
acid O
crystals O
with O
a O
normal O
uric O
acid O
blood O
level. O
An O
abdominal O
ultrasound O
was O
ordered O
which O
was O
unremarkable O
except O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
slight O
abnormality O
in O
the O
right O
pole O
of O
a O
kidney. O
IVP O
was O
recommended O
by O
the O
radiologist O
for O
follow-up. O
He O
was O
given O
Toradol O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
with O
minimal O
improvement O
and O
sent O
home O
with O
some O
Motrin O
with O
the O
follow-up O
to O
be O
by O
me O
in O
Internal O
Medicine O
Clinic. O
I O
was O
called O
by O
the O
patient O
this O
morning O
complaining O
of O
worsening O
pain O
in O
his O
right O
flank. O
On O
it, O
patient O
states O
he O
is O
unable O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
Pontiac O
State O
Hospital O
to O
my O
Internal O
Medicine O
Clinic. O
On O
exam O
he O
was O
afebrile O
and O
his O
exam O
was O
notable O
for O
a O
right O
CVA O
tenderness O
with O
pain O
radiating O
around O
to O
his O
abdomen O
and O
exacerbated O
by O
pushing O
on O
his O
abdomen. O
Patient O
has O
good O
bowel O
sounds O
throughout O
and O
there O
are O
no O
peritoneal O
signs. O
Assessment O
and O
Plan: O
While O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
his O
possible O
renal O
pathology O
I O
believe O
that O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
chance O
that O
this O

a O

and O

to O
rule O
out O

Of O
note, O
patient O
does O
have O
a O
history O
of O
peptic O

disease, O
however, O
he O
was O
guaiac O
negative O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
and O
reports O
no O
episodes O
of O
hematemesis, O
hematochezia, O
or O

He O
is O
also O

Dear O
Dr. O
Short: O
I O
did O
see O
Irene O
Upshur O
for O
a O
followup O
today. O
As O
you O
know, O
I O
did O
see O
her O
back O
in O
September O
where O
she O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
possible O
right-sided O
eustachian O
tube O
dysfunction. O
Her O
blood O
sugars O
have O
been O
under O
reasonably O
good O
control, O
88 O
and O
then O
300. DIABETES
She O
reports O
that O
her O
hearing O
has O
continued O
to O
fluctuate. O
When O
questioned, O
she O
reports O
that O
she O
only O
used O
the O
nose O
spray O
twice O
since O
I O
did O
prescribe O
it. O
On O
examination O
today, O
she O
otherwise O
appears O
well. O
Ears O
are O
unremarkable. O
Her O
eardrums O
are O
intact. O
She O
has O
no O
tympanosclerosis O
or O
cholesteatoma. O
Her O
gait O
is O
normal. O
There O
is O
no O
nystagmus. O
An O
audiogram O
done O
today O
does O
show O
a O
sloping O
high O
frequency O
sensorineural O
hearing O
loss, O
which O
is O
symmetric. O
Her O
discrimination O
scores O
are O
100% O
in O
the O
right O
ear O
and O
100% O
in O
the O
left O
ear. O
Assessment: O
Mild O
ear O
fullness O
with O
dysequilibrium O
and O
blockage. O
Plan: O
She O
does O
take O
multiple O
medications. O
It O
continues O
to O
be O
very O
unclear O
to O
me O
what O
her O
underlying O
causality O
is. O
I O
would O
like O
her O
to O
use O
the O
nasal O
spray O
more O
consistently. O
If O
she O
does O
fail O
this O
and O
this O
is O
not O
eustachian O
tube O
dysfunction, O
I O
would O
consider O
her O
to O
have O
endolymphatic O
hydrops. O
This O
would O
respond O
hopefully O
to O
a O
diuretic O
and O
potassium O
supplementation. O
However, O
she O
has O
taken O
multiple O
medications O
currently O
for O
both O
blood O
pressure O
including O
atenolol, MEDICATION
Cozaar, MEDICATION
Lasix, O
and O
verapamil. MEDICATION
I O
would O
need O
to O
clear O
to O
switch O
herself O
??____?? O
therapy, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
her O
back O
after O
consistent O
trial O
of O
the O
corticosteroid O
spray O
topically. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Pacheco: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient, O
Donn O
Emery, O
in O
the O
Internal O
Medicine O
recently. O
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
kind O
referral. O
I O
will O
summarize O
his O
history O
and O
physical O
examination O
for O
my O
own O
records. O
Mr. O
Emery O
is O
a O
86-year-old O
right-handed O
gentleman O
who O
is O
referred O
with O
complaint O
and O
electrophysiologic O
findings O
consistent O
with O
a O
generalized O
sensory O
motor O
polyneuropathy. O
His O
symptoms O
began O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago O
when O
he O
noticed O
bilateral O
loss O
of O
sensation O
at O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
fingers O
in O
the O
hands. O
This O
had O
extended O
over O
several O
months O
to O
include O
his O
feet O
as O
well. O
Over O
many O
months O
to O
years O
he O
has O
noticed O
a O
weakness O
of O
his O
grip O
bilaterally, O
which O
over O
the O
more O
recent O
period O
of O
time O
encompassing O
the O
last O
year O
has O
been O
worse O
on O
the O
left. O
At O
one O
time O
that O
grip O
weakness O
was O
ascribed O
to O
possible O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome O
and O
he O
underwent O
a O
right O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
on O
the O
right O
approximately O
four O
years O
ago. O
Three O
weeks O
ago O
he O
underwent O
a O
left O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
for O
these O
same O
symptoms. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
falls, O
but O
does O
note O
some O
unsteadiness O
on O
his O
feet. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
sensations O
of O
tingling O
or O
loss O
of O
sensory O
stimulus O
around O
his O
face. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
diplopia, O
dysarthria, O
dysphagia, O
or O
bowel O
or O
bladder O
complaints O
that O
might O
be O
related O
to O
neurologic O
problems. O
He O
has O
occasional O
shortness O
of O
breath O
on O
exertion. O
Otherwise, O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
medical O
and O
neurologic O
review O
of O
systems O
is O
unremarkable. O
Past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
a O
past O
episode O
of O
urethral O
stones, O
history O
of O
lymphoma O
of O
unclear O
type O
by O
the O
medical O
record O
but O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
non-Hodgkins. O
He O
is O
undergoing O
extensive O
surveillance O
on O
a O
yearly O
basis O
for O
recurrence. O
He O
has O
a O
history O
of O
prostate O
hypertrophy, O
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
and O
longstanding O
history O
of O
noninsulin-dependent DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES
since O
the O
age O
of O
50. O
His O
glucose O
control O
by O
his O
history O
has O
been O
very O
good. O
He O
has O
lumbar O
back O
pain, O
a O
history O
of O
a O
heart O
murmur. O
Current O
medications O
include O
aspirin, MEDICATION
Cozaar, MEDICATION
clopamide, O
Triamterene, O
Tenormin, MEDICATION
and O
Glucophage. MEDICATION
He O
has O
no O
known O
drug O
allergies. O
He O
does SMOKER
not SMOKER
smoke, SMOKER
uses O
alcohol O
socially, O
lives O
in O
Juneau O
South, O
has O
no O
obvious O
toxin O
exposure O
to O
heavy O
metals. O
His O
family O
history O
is O
negative O
for O
obvious O
neuromuscular O
disease. O
He O
had O
a O
brother O
who O
died O
in O
his O
50s O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
brain O
infection. O
He O
has O
several O
children, O
all O
in O
good O
health. O
On O
my O
examination O
today, O
he O
is O
alert O
and O
well O
appearing, O
with O
good O
concentration, O
memory, O
and O
language O
function. O
No O
carotid O
bruits O
could O
be O
appreciated. O
The O
peripheral O
vascular O
examination O
revealed O
weak O
pulses O
in O
all O
four O
limbs. O
He O
had O
full O
extraocular O
motility, O
with O
normal O
visual O
fields O
bilaterally. O
Funduscopy O
was O
normal O
bilaterally. O
Pupillary O
reflexes O
were O
intact O
to O
both O
light O
and O
near O
stimulation. O
The O
muscles O
of O
facial O
expression, O
mastication, O
and O
the O
lower O
bulbar O
musculature O
were O
intact O
bilaterally. O
Facial O
sensation O
was O
intact O
bilaterally O
to O
light O
touch. O
On O
motor O
examination, O
occasional O
fasciculations O
were O
seen O
throughout. O
There O
was O
clear O
wasting O
of O
the O
intrinsic O
muscles O
of O
the O
hands O
bilaterally, O
and O
trace O
weakness O
at O
IV+/V O
by O
MRC O
criteria O
in O
a O
symmetric O
distribution O
of O
the O
hands O
bilaterally. O
Otherwise, O
muscles O
of O
the O
proximal O
shoulder O
girdle, O
forearm, O
and O
upper O
arm O
were O
V/V O
bilaterally. O
In O
the O
lower O
extremities, O
again, O
distal O
muscle O
wasting O
was O
noted, O
although O
power O
in O
all O
muscle O
groups O
was O
full. O
Sensation O
testing O
revealed O
a O
moderate-to-severe O
deficit O
in O
vibratory O
and O
joint O
position O
sense O
distally O
in O
the O
lower O
extremities. O
Temperature, O
pinprick O
and O
light O
touch O
sensation O
appeared O
to O
be O
intact. O
There O
was O
no O
dysmetria O
on O
finger-nose-finger O
testing, O
and O
gait O
was O
not O
ataxic. O
Romberg O
was O
slightly O
positive O
with O
sway O
but O
no O
fall. O
Deep O
tendon O
reflexes O
were O
hyporeflexic O
throughout. O
Specifically O
I+ O
reflexes O
were O
elicited O
in O
the O
patellar O
tendons O
in O
a O
symmetric O
distribution, O
trace O
ankle O
jerks O
were O
elicited, O
and O
I+ O
reflexes O
were O
elicited O
in O
the O
biceps, O
triceps, O
and O
brachioradialis. O
There O
was O
no O
jaw O
jerk. O
Toes O
were O
downgoing O
bilaterally. O
Mr. O
Emery O
has O
already O
undergone O
EMG O
nerve O
conduction O
study O
recently O
at O
this O
institution. O
Those O
results O
were O
available O
for O
me O
today. O
They O
are O
consistent O
with O
a O
generalized O
axonal O
sensory O
motor O
polyneuropathy, O
which O
is O
moderate O
in O
distal O
extremities. O
Both O
active O
and O
chronic O
denervation O
changes O
are O
seen O
on O
the O
EMG. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
demyelinating O
phenotype, O
and O
nerve O
conduction O
does O
reveal O
a O
conduction O
block O
at O
common O
sites O
of O
compression O
of O
the O
median O
nerve O
in O
the O
wrist, O
consistent O
with O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome. O
Given O
the O
apparent O
chronic O
nature O
of O
Mr. O
Emery's O
complaints, O
an O
axonal O
sensory O
motor O
neuropathy O
most O
likely O
idiopathic O
in O
origin, O
or O
more O
probably O
related O
to O
the O
diabetes O
is O
the O
likely O
diagnosis. O
With O
respect O
to O
the O
weakness O
in O
the O
hands, O
which O
appears O
to O
encompass O
more O
muscle O
groups O
than O
would O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
a O
median O
nerve O
compression O
at O
the O
wrist, O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
consequence O
of O
this O
longstanding O
axonal O
degeneration. O
There O
is O
no O
abnormality O
on O
the O
history, O
examination, O
or O
current O
electrophysiology O
that O
would O
lead O
me O
to O
suspect O
this O
is O
anything O
more O
unusual. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
diabetes, O
of O
course O
the O
primary O
concern O
would O
be O
lymphoma-related O
neuropathy, O
either O
related O
to O
direct O
lymphomatous O
invasion O
of O
the O
perineurium, O
or O
more O
often O
as O
a O
perineoplastic O
phenomenon. O
The O
very O
chronic O
nature O
of O
his O
symptoms O
would O
argue O
against O
this O
as O
a O
likely O
etiology, O
and O
he O
is, O
of O
course, O
undergoing O
extensive O
surveillance O
for O
such O
a O
recurrence. O
I O
would O
not O
think O
that O
his O
current O
symptomatology O
would O
be O
any O
cause O
for O
greater O
concern O
regarding O
new O
recurrence O
of O
his O
illness. O
Unfortunately, O
as O
you O
know, O
we O
are O
not O
able O
to O
offer O
anything O
in O
the O
way O
of O
therapy O
for O
this O
at O
this O
time. O
We O
can O
certainly O
treat O
any O
positive O
symptoms O
of O
painful O
dysesthesias O
fairly O
effectively O
with O
antineuropathic O
pain O
medications O
such O
as O
Amitriptyline, O
Gabapentin, O
or O
sodium O
channel O
agents O
such O
as O
phenytoin O
or O
_____. O
However, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
prominent O
complaint O
of O
Mr. O
Emery's O
and O
this O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
helpful O
for O
him. O
Nevertheless, O
there O
may O
be O
other O
therapies O
in O
the O
near O
future O
that O
might O
be O
available O
for O
this O
type O
of O
problem. O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
continue O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Emery O
on O
a O
roughly O
yearly O
basis, O
so O
that O
he O
can O
keep O
in O
touch O
and O
be O
made O
aware O
of O
any O
therapy O
that O
might O
be O
helpful O
and O
available O
for O
him O
in O
the O
future. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
call O
me. O
Once O
again, O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
kind O
referral. O

REVIEW O
OF O
STUDIES: O
Blood O
studies O
on O
November O
14, O
2096 O
were O
satisfactory O
except O
for O
a O
BUN O
of O
41 O
with O
a O
creatinine O
of O
1.3. O
I O
assume O
that O
that O
will O
be O
part O
of O
the O
checking O
up, O
which O
Dr. O
Pina O
will O
be O
doing. O
A O
chest O
CT O
scan O
on O
December O
22, O
2096 O
showed O
no O
change O
in O
the O
small O
mediastinal O
nodes, O
but O
I O
will O
plan, O
just O
to O
be O
sure, O
to O
do O
a O
chest O
CT O
scan O
and O
an O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O
in O
six O
months. O
If O
those O
studies O
are O
stable O
and O
satisfactory, O
I O
discussed O
with O
Mr. O
Emery O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
may O
not O
do O
scans O
subsequently O
given O
the O
absence O

His O
average O
control O
has O
apparently O
been O
good O
on O
the O
combination O
of O
chlorpropamide O
and O
metformin, O
although O
we O
cannot O
be O
sure O
of O
that O
in O
view O
of O
his O
anemia O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
not O
testing O
his O
glucose O
at O
home. O
Metformin O
is O
relatively O
contraindicated O
since O
his O
GRF O
is O
certainly O
diminished O
with O
creatinine O

at O

I O
have O
not O
addressed O
the O
issue O
of O
long O
term O
insulin O
use O
with O
him, O
although O
it O
would O
be O
my O
first O
choice. O
Even O
at O
his O
age, O
I O
suspect O
that O
he O
would O
have O
no O
difficulty O
mastering O
it O
given O
his O
relatively O
youthful O
mind. O
Other O
alternatives O
would O
be O
sulfonylureas O
(if O
forced O
to O
use O
one, O
would O
choose O
glimepiride) O
and O
glitinides, O
for O

repaglinide. O

this O

The O
patient O
was O
last O
seen O
in O
outpatient O
vascular O
medicine O
follow-up O
by O
Dr. O
Levi O
Barton O
at O
the O
OAC O
04/09/2078, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
reported O
recurrent O
and O
persistent O
BLE O
claudication O
symptoms, O
RLE O
&gt; O
LLE, O
with O
pain O
in O
his O
buttocks, O
thighs, O
and O
calves O
with O
ambulation. O
He O
reports O
that O
these O
symptoms, O
coupled O
with O
his O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
symptoms, O
have O
become O
quite O
debilitating O
and O
lifestyle-limiting. O
The O
patient O
denies O
any O
chronic O
or O
poorly-healing O
ulcers O
or O
sores O
on O
his O
feet O
or O
lower O
extremities. O
Given O
his O
history O
and O
symptomatic O
complaints, O
Dr. O
Barton O
recommended O
that O
the O
patient O
be O
scheduled O
to O
undergo O
an O
elective O
peripheral O
arteriogram O
to O
re-assess O
his O
PAD O
and, O
if O
indicated O
and O
feasible, O
to O
pursue O
percutaneous O
revascularization. O
The O
patient O
had O
previously O
undergone O
a O
peripheral O
angiogram O
at O
the O
OAC O
on O
11/21/2077, O
performed O
by O
Dr. O
Barton, O
which O
culminated O
in O
PTA O
and O
stenting O
to O
the O
R O
EIA O
and O
the O
distal O
L O
SFA, O
the O
former O
with O
a O
balloon-expandable O
biliary O
stent O
and O
the O
latter O
with O
a O
self-expanding O
biliary O
stent. O
Follow-up O
lower O
extremity O
non-invasive O
studies O
performed O
at O
the O
OAC O
in O
01/2078 O
revealed O
a O
depressed O
resting O
ABI O
of O
0.70 O
in O
the O
RLE, O
which O
dropped O
to O
0.24 O
following O
exercise O
(as O
well O
as O
a O
resting O
ABI O
of O
1.00 O
in O
the O
LLE O
which O
decreased O
to O
0.50 O
post-exercise). O
The O
patient O
has O
not O
been O
treated O
with O
Pletal O
in O
the O
past. O
An O
important O
side O
note O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
patient's O
diagnostic CAD
LHC CAD
procedure CAD
at CAD
the CAD
OAC CAD
in CAD
10/2077 CAD
revealed CAD
significant CAD
4-vessel CAD
CAD, CAD
which O
for O
some O
reason O
was O
treated O
medically O
rather O
than O
surgically O
or O
percutaneously. O
The O
patient O
has O
expressed O
a O
desire O
to O
have O
his O
coronary O
arteries O
re-assessed O
by O
angiography O
during O
today's O
peripheral O
catheterization O
procedure, O
not O
particularly O
because O
of O
any O
recurrent O
CP O
but O
mostly O
out O
of O
concern O
that O
his O
CAD O
may O
have O
worsened O
and O
because O
he O
may O
undergo O
surgery O
for O
his O

Dear O

Thank O

Uriah O
Lara O
to O
the O
Georgia O
Regional. O
He's O
a O
51 O
year O
old O
male O
who O
approximately O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
developed O
a O
pain O
and O
stiffness O
in O
his O
neck O
that O
limits O
his O
range O
of O
motion. O
Approximately O
5 O
days O
ago O
he O
developed O
acute, O
severe O
and O
boring O
pain O
at O
the O
right O
trapezius O
and O
medial O
scapular O
that O
limits O
his O
ability O
to O
sleep O
and O
function. O
Toradol, O
anti-inflammatory O
muscle O
relaxants O
and O
Percocet O
were O
of O
minimal O
help. O
He O
had O
no O
other O
constitutional O
symptoms; O
fevers, O
rashes. O
He O
had O
noticed O
some O
numbness O
and O
tingling O
down O
the O
right O
5th O
finger O
and O
the O
pain O
would O
often O
travel O
down O
the O
outer O
part O
of O
the O
triceps O
region O
to O
the O
elbow O
and O
down O
to O
the O
right O
5th O
finger. O
He O
notes O
certain O
positions O
will O
alleviate O
the O
pain. O
He O
then O
presented O
to O
a O
chiropractor O
on O
Saturday O
who O
manipulated O
his O
back, O
obtained O
x-rays O
which O
showed O
no O

Dear O
Kenneth: O
Mr. O
Lara O
returned O
today O
after O
a O
1-year O
hiatus O
because O
of O
coronary CAD
disease, CAD
status CAD
post CAD
percutaneous CAD
intervention. CAD
He O
states O
that O
his O
general O
health O
has O
been O
stable O
over O
the O
past O
year O
but O
over O
the O
past O
several O
months O
he O
has O
noted, O
particularly O
in O
the O
hot O
weather, O
a O
sense O
of O
dyspnea O
after O
walking O
about O
170 O
feet O
to O
his O
mailbox, O
or O
across O
a O
large O
parking O
lot, O
such O
as O
Grand O
Union. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
activity O
he O
tends O
to O
note O
a O
sense O
of O
regular O
fluttering O
in O
his O
chest O
that O
persists O
for O
a O
minute O
or O
two, O
and O
he O
has O
also O
noted O
the O
latter O
almost O
every O
night O
when O
first O
lying O
in O
bed. O
He O
has O
not O
had O
any O
recurrent O
orthostatic O
symptoms O
since O
his O
Toprol MEDICATION
dose O
was O
reduced O
last O
year. O
He O
has O
not O
had O
any O
exertionally O
related O
chest O
discomfort O
or O
symptoms O
similar O
to O
those O
prior O
to O
his O

In O
summary, O
Mr. O
Lara O
has: O
1. O
History O
of O
CAD, CAD
status CAD
placement CAD
of CAD
a CAD
drug-eluting CAD
stent CAD
in CAD
the CAD
LAD, CAD
7/92, O
without O
recurrent O
angina O
or O
signs O
of O
left O
ventricular O
dysfunction. O
Repeat O
cardiac O
catheterization, O
12/92, O
because O
of O
chest O
discomfort O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
restenosis. O
2. O
Hypertension, HYPERTENSION
not O
controlled. O
His O
elevated O
blood O
pressure O
may O
well O
be O
contributing O
to O
his O
sense O
of O
exertional O
dyspnea. O
We O
spoke O
about O
the O
options. O
As O
he O
had O
developed O
orthostatic O
symptoms O
previously O
on O
higher-dose O
beta O
blocker O
and O
possibly O
lisinopril, MEDICATION
will O
use O
smaller O
doses O
of O
alternate O
agents O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
lower O
his O
pressure. O
He O
will O
add MEDICATION
hydrochlorothiazide MEDICATION
25 O
mg O
daily O
plus MEDICATION
amlodipine MEDICATION
2.5 O
mg O
daily O
starting O
today O
and O
already O
has O
a O
follow O
up O
appointment O
with O
you O
next O
week. O
To O
investigate O
potential O
contributions O
to O
the O
elevated O
pressure O
and O
sense O
of O
tachycardia, O
blood O
studies O
today O
will O
include O
electrolytes, O
plasma O
metanephrine O
level O
and O
TSH. O
A O
Holter O
monitor O
will O
also O
be O
placed O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
determine O
what O
he O
is O
experiencing O
with O
the O
sense O
of O
'fluttering' O
which O
occurs O
at O
least O
nightly. O
Once O
his O
blood O
pressure O
is O
controlled, O
an O
exercise O
test O
will O
follow. O
[Addendum: O
Holter O
shows O
single O
VPBs/bigeminy O
at O
time O
of O
his O
symptoms. O
Blood O
studies O
show O
normal O
plasma O
metanephrines. O
He O
reports O
feeling O
better O
with O
systolic O
BP O
in O
the O
120's O
on O
September O
18, O
no O
further O
palpitations. O
He O
will O
continue O
to O
monitor O
BP O
and O
will O
call O
in O
to O
schedule O
ETT] O
3. O
Dyslipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
on O
combined O
statin O
plus O
gemfibrozil MEDICATION
therapy. O
When O
it O
is O
time O
to O
renew O
his O
Lopid, O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
switch MEDICATION
to MEDICATION
TriCor MEDICATION
to O
reduce O
the O
potential O
interaction O
with O
statins O
with O
respect O
to O
myopathy. O
A O
serum O
CK O
will O
be O
included O
in O
today's O
blood O
studies. O
4. O
Mild O
mitral O
regurgitation. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Lara O
today O
and O
I O
will O
report O
back O
to O
you O
following O
his O
Holter. O
With O

with O
a O

who O
had O

that O
revealed O
several O

HISTORY O
OF O
THE O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
Mr. O
Xayavong O
is O
a O
62 O
year O
old O
man O
with O
a O
history O
of O
CAD CAD
(s/p CAD
STEMI CAD
and CAD
multiple CAD
stents), CAD
CHF O
(s/p O
BiV O
ICD, O
class O
D O
and O
stage O
III), O
DM, O
and O
CRI O
who O
was O
admitted O
for O
tailored O
therapy O
after O
a O
routine O
RHC O
demonstrated O
elevated O
filling O
pressures. O
Mr. O
Xayavong O
has O
a O
primary O
cardiologist O
(Dr. O
Marshall) O
in O
Gloucester O
and O
has O
received O
much O
medical O
care O
at O
Oregon O
City O
Hospital. O
He O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
Dr. O
Ashlei O
Tyson O
for O
the O
possibility O
of O
cardiac O
transplantation O
and O
has O
intermittently O
been O
admitted O
to O
GNC. O
He O
was O
admitted O
to O
GNC O
from O
6/13/82 O
to O
6/19/82 O
after O
being O
found O
to O
be O
in O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
hypotension, O
fatigue, O
and O
nausea; O
this O
was O
2 O
weeks O
after O
the O
placement O
of O
his O
BiV O
ICD. O
He O
converted O
to O
sinus O
rhythm O
after O
amiodarone O
was O
administered, O
but O
developed O
a O
marked O
transaminitis. O
Due O
to O
elevated O
filling O
pressures O
(PCWP O
23), O
he O
required O
IV O
Lasix O
for O
diuresis. O
He O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
poor O
candidate O
for O
CABG O
given O
the O
degree O
of O
heart O
failure, O
so O
transplantation O
was O
instead O
pursued. O
He O
was O
also O
admitted O
to O
GNC O
from O
11/10/82 O
through O
11/13/82 O
after O
again O
being O
found O
with O
elevated O
filling O
pressures O
after O
complaining O
of O
fatigue O
(PCWP O
37); O
he O
received O
a O
PA O
line O
and O
required O
a O
Lasix O
drip O
and O
IV O
nitroprusside. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge, O
his O
reported O
dry O
weight O
was O
206 O
lbs. O
He O
came O
for O
a O
scheduled O
right-sided O
heart O
catheterization O
today O
as O
he O
has O
had O
increasing O
complaint O
of O
fatigue. O
He O
reports O
that O
he O
has O
been O
feeling O
&#8220;lousy,&#8221; O
that O
his O
appetite O
has O
been O
&#8220;crummy,&#8221; O
and O
that O
he O
is O
&#8220;feeling O
real O
tired.&#8221; O
He O
feels O
that O
these O
symptoms O
have O
been O
relatively O
severe O
but O
unchanged O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
years. O
He O
denies O
overt O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
but O
essentially O
fatigues O
very O
easily O
with O
physical O
exertion, O
and O
has O
been O
requiring O
multiple O
naps O
a O
day. O
He O
states O
that O
he O
has O
been O
careful O
with O
his O
diet O
(both O
fluid O
and O
salt O
intake) O
without O
any O
changes, O
and O
that O
he O
has O
been O
entirely O
compliant O
with O
his O
medications. O
Of O
note, O
his O
cardiologist O
attempted O
to O
change O
him O
from O
Toprol MEDICATION
XL O
to O
Coreg MEDICATION
several O
months O
ago, O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
made O
him O
feel O
worse. O
He O
continues O
to O
urinate O
to O
his O
home O
Lasix O
dosing. O
He O
denies O
any O
sensation O
of O
chest O
pain O
or O
chest O
pressure, O
and O
denies O
chest O
palpitations O
or O
sensation O
of O
fluttering; O
he O
states O
clearly O
that O
he O
could O
tell O
when O
his O
heart O
was O
in O
an O
abnormal O
rhythm O
in O
6/72. O
He O
says O
that O
his O
pacemaker O
was O
&#8220;checked&#8221; O
last O
week O
and O
that O
he O
was O
told O
he O
didn&#8217;t O
have O
any O
&#8220;episodes.&#8221; O
He O
believes O
that O
he O
has O
been O
putting O
on O
weight O
recently, O
and O
reports O
that O
his O
baseline O
weight O
is O
~225 O
lbs. O
He O
denies O
recent O
fevers O
or O
chills. O
He O
has O
no O
complaint O
of O

DOB: O
10/11/2082 O
Thank O
you O
for O
referring O
Mr. O
Dejesus O
to O
the O
Erie O
County O
Arrhythmia O
Service O
for O
consideration O
of O
catheter O
ablation O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation. O
As O
you O
know O
him O
well, O
I O
will O
summarize O
his O
history O
briefly O
for O
our O
records. O
Mr. O
Dejesus O
is O
a O
78-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
an O
extensive O
cardiac O
history O
that O
includes O
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease CAD
status CAD
post CAD
multiple CAD
percutaneous CAD
coronary CAD
interventions CAD
and CAD
stents CAD
to CAD
the CAD
LAD CAD
as CAD
well CAD
as CAD
RCA CAD
territories, CAD
a O
cardiomyopathy CAD
with CAD
an CAD
ejection CAD
fraction CAD
of CAD
approximately CAD
35-40%, CAD
and O
atrial O
fibrillation. O
In O
addition, O
he O
has O
multiple O
cardiac O
risk O
factors O
including O
diabetes, DIABETES
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
dyslipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea. O
In O
addition O
to O
disease O
in O
his O
coronary O
vascular O
bed, O
he O
has O
a O
history O
of O
carotid O
disease O
status O
post O
left O
CEA. O
He O
came O
to O
your O
attention O
early O
this O
year O
with O
symptoms O
of O
exertional O
dyspnea. O
On O
further O
questioning, O
he O
reports O
feeling O
quite O
symptomatic O
when O
ambulating O
relatively O
short O
distances O
around O
his O
home O
or O
up O
and O
down O
the O
driveway. O
He O
can O
walk O
no O
further O
than O
approximately O
50-100 O
feet O
before O
developing O
significant O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
fatigue. O
He O
was O
recently O
diagnosed O
as O
having O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
that O
has O
transitioned O
to O
persistent. O
He O
has O
undergone O
multiple O
cardioversions O
most O
recently O
in O
03/19/2161, O
but O
was O
unsuccessful. O
Prior O
to O
that, O
cardioversion O
in O
February O
resulted O
in O
a O
brief O
period O
of O
restoration O
of O
sinus O
rhythm O
during O
which O
time O
he O
felt O
symptomatically O
improved. O
He O
also O
describes O
occasional O
fleeting O
episodes O
of O
sharp O
left-sided O
chest O
discomfort. O
Cardiac CAD
catheterization CAD
on CAD
01/18/2161 CAD
revealed CAD
a CAD
30% CAD
LAD CAD
in-stent CAD
restenosis, CAD
90% CAD
septal CAD
lesion, CAD
and CAD
65% CAD
-70% CAD
PDA CAD
lesion CAD
that O
was CAD
stented. CAD
A O
Ventriculogram O
at O
that O
time O
revealed O
an O
EF O
of O
35-40%. O
Other O
than O
significant O
exertional O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
he O
feels O
relatively O
well. O
He O
has O
occasional O
symptoms O
of O
orthostatic O
lightheadedness O
but O
no O
history O
of O
syncope. O
He O
denies O

Overall, O
Mr. O
Dejesus O
is O
a O
pleasant O
78-year-old O
man O
with O
a O
complex O
prior O
medical O
history O
who O
appears O
to O
have O
persistent O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
a O
principal O
functional O
limitation O
of O
exertional O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
He O
appears O
to O
be O
functional O
class O
III. O
He O
does O
not O
have O
any O
frank O
evidence O
of O
volume O
overload O
on O
exam O
today, O
though O
his O
ventricular O
function O
and O
is O
not O
entirely O
normal. O
Moreover, O
he O
has O
multiple O
comorbidities O
which O
may O
exacerbate O
his O
exertional O
dyspnea O
including O
COPD O
and O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
We O
discussed O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
Mr. O
Dejesus O
and O
his O
family O
today. O
We O
explained O
that O
the O
brief O
period O
of O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
associated O
with O
symptomatic O
improvement O
may O
be O
a O
reason O
to O
proceed O
with O
catheter O
ablation. O
However, O
given O
his O
comorbidities O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
persistent O
arrhythmia O
we O
warned O
that O
a O
single O
catheter O
ablation O
procedure O
may O
not O
be O
entirely O
successful O
and O
that O
waiting O
period O
of O
approximately O
3-4 O
month O
post-ablation O
may O
be O
required O
to O
adjudicate O
success. O
Given O
the O
length O
of O
the O
procedure O
as O
well O
as O
his O
comorbidities, O
we O
feel O
reasonable O
to O
consult O
with O
our O
anesthesia O
colleagues O
for O
possible O
consideration O
of O
performing O
the O
procedure O
under O
general O
anesthesia O
versus O
with O
MAC O
and O
had O
procedural O
sedation. O
We O
will O
leave O
this O
decision O
to O
them. O
Moreover, O
prior O
to O
the O
ablation, O
we O
will O
request O
a O
transesophageal O
echocardiogram O
to O
rule O
out O
left O
atrial O
clot O
prior O
to O
ablation. O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
referring O
Mr. O
Dejesus O
to O
our O
care. O
We O
will O
be O
in O
touch O
following O
the O
procedure. O
As O
always, O
feel O
free O
to O
call O
with O
any O
questions. O
Sincerely, O

he O
underwent O
dolbutamine CAD
stress CAD
test CAD
on CAD
9/30/87, CAD
which CAD
revealed CAD
a CAD

Based O
on O
this, O
he O
was O
admitted O

he CAD
underwent CAD
stenting CAD

He O
has O
had O
recent O
significant O

his O
L O
knee O

It O
has O
now O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
limits O
his O
ability O
to O
walk, O
so O
that O
he O
can O
only O
'limp O
less O

and O
has O
difficulty O

Given O
that O
he O
has O
done O
well O
from O

since O
his O

he O

managed O
as O
an O

He O

ADDENDUM: O
In O
reviewing O
patient's O
medical O
records O
after O
he O
left O
today, O
I O
found O
mention O
of O
both O
hematuria O
and O
guaiac O
positive O
stool O
during O
his O
recent O
hospitalizations. O
At O
this O
time, O
he O
was O
quite O
debilitated O
and O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
time O
for O
colonoscopy. O
He O
did O
deny O
abdominal O
symptoms O
as O
part O
of O
my O
review O
of O
systems O
today. O
At O
this O
point, O
my O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
send O
him O
some O
stool O
guaiac O
cards O
which O
he O
can O
do O
at O
home O
and O
send O
in O
to O
me O
by O
mail. O
I O
have O
also O
sent O
off O
a O
CBC O
today. O
I O
will O
plan O
to O
repeat O
urinalysis O
at O
his O
next O
visit. O
If O
he O
has O
persistent O
hematuria O
or O
guaiac O
positive O
stool, O
then O
we O
will O
need O
to O
discuss O
more O
aggressive O
work-up, O
but O
given O
his O
overall O
health O
condition, O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
be O
aggressive O
at O
this O
time O
and O
would O
like O
to O
see O
him O
get O
some O
strength O
back O
first. O

PROBLEMS: O
PVD: O
since O
last O

he O
was O
admitted O
to O
MCH O
with O
gangrene O
in O
his O
left O
second O
toe. O
Admitted O
MCH O
8/29 O
through O
9/9/92. O
Treated O
by O

Underwent O
extensive O
revascularization O
including O
right O
common O

With O
this O

only O
his O
left O
second O

remained O
gangrenous O
and O
he O
was O
able O
to O
avoid O
BKA. O
He O
will O
likely O
either O
auto-amputate O
or O
will O
require O
amputation O
of O
his O
left O
second O

he O
has O
reasonable O

Renal O
insufficiency: O
during O
his O
hospitalization O
he O
bumped O
his O
creatinine O
quite O
a O
bit O
but O
this O
appeared O
to O
be O
due O
to O
acute O

he O
developed O
quite O
a O

called O

and O
I O
increased O
his O

1) O
Coronary O

Bare O
metal O

only O
are O
in O
place O
in O

RCA O
territory, O
and O
he O
has O
now O
completed O
over O
a O
12 O
month O
course O
of O
Plavix O
therapy. O
Given O
that O
the O
main O
treatment O
plan O
at O
this O
time O
for O
his O
ankylosing O
spondylitis O
is O
NSAIDs O
(i.e. O
Motrin), O
he O
will O
stop MEDICATION
Plavix MEDICATION
to O
help O
minimize O
the O
bleeding O
risk O
and O
since O
there O
is O
no O
absolute O
indication O
for O
him O
to O
continue O
it O
at O
this O
point. O
He O
will O
continue O
the O

of O
ASA O
81mg O

Lipitor O
20mg O

Toprol O
XL O

and O
Lisinopril MEDICATION
10mg O

His O
heart O
rate O
and O
blood O

are O
well O
controlled. O
The O
chest O
pain O
syndrome O
that O
he O
has O
been O
having O
for O
the O
past O
several O
days O
is O
reassuring O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
is O
not O
exertion O
related O
and O
it O
seems O
similar O
to O
March O
when O
he O
had O
an O
ETT-MIBI O
without O
ischemia O
on O
perfusion O
images. O
He O
does O
have O
a O
known CAD
70% CAD
stenosis CAD
in CAD
a CAD
non-dominant CAD
LCx, CAD
but O
two O
imaging O
studies O
have O
not O
shown O
ischemia O
in O
that O
territory. O
His O
ECG O
today O
is O
unchanged O
from O
priors. O
However, O
given O
his O
history O
we O
will O
be O
vigilant O
for O
any O
change O
or O
persistence O
in O
symptoms. O
I O
will O
call O
the O
patient O
in O
several O
days O
time, O
and O
if O
he O
continues O
to O
have O
symptoms O
he O
can O
have O
a O
repeat O

His O
LDL O
has O
been O
well O

however O
his O
HDL O
has O
been O
very O
low O
on O
several O

Given O
this, O
along O
with O
an O

we O

He O
can O
start O

the O

2-3 O
weeks O
to O
help O
get O
through O
the O

He O
should O

water O
and O
may O
take O
his O

After O
a O

Ms. O

returns O
today O
for O
a O
follow-up O
status O
post O
her O
coronary CAD
artery CAD
bypass CAD
surgery CAD
on CAD
4/1/69. CAD
Since O
the O
surgery O
she O
has O
done O
quite O
well. O
She O
was O
in O
Sibley O
Care O
Center O
from O
4/08 O
to O
4/22/69 O
and O
had O
undergone O
physical O
therapy, O
occupational O
therapy O
and O
also O
education O
on O
dietary O
modification. O
During O
her O
hospital O
course O
she O
had O
a O
repeat O
echocardiogram O
which O
revealed O
a O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
50% O
and O
hypokinesis O
of O
the O
septal O
wall O
with O
mild O
to O
moderate O
pulmonary O
artery O
hypertension. O
She O
was O
started O
on O
lisinopril MEDICATION
to O
help O
prevent O
diabetic O
nephropathy. O
She O
also O
received O
two O
units O
of O
packed O
red O
blood O
cells O
at O
her O
stay O
at O
Sibley O
Care O
as O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
her O
hematocrit O
was O
only O
24. O
She O
was O
also O
briefly O
treated O
with O
Epogen O
and O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
her O
renal O
dysfunction O
may O
have O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
low O
hematocrit. O
Her O
renal O
function O
has O
improved O
considerably O
since O
stopping O
diuretics. O
Since O
going O
home O
from O
Sibley O

she O
is O
starting O
to O
walk O

since O
her O

here O
about O
a O

At O
this O
point O
in O

however, O
I O
think O
that O
we O
need O
to O
cut O
back O
on O
her O

given O
the O
elevation O
in O
her O

and O
I've O
asked O
her O
to O
hold O
her O

and O
continue O
on O
a O
relatively O

to O
have O

she O

Should O

Patient O
was O

Review O
of O
systems: O
Patient O
states O
that O
he O
has O
very O
infrequent O
episodes O
of O
chest O
pains O
over O
the O
last O
10 O
years. O
However, O
he O
does O
say O
that O
his O
last O
chest O
pain O
was O
approximately O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half O
ago. O
When O
asked O
where O
the O
pain O
was O
he O
put O
his O
hand O
over O
this O
mid-epigastrium O
and O
stated O
that O
the O
pain O
was O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
pain O
he O
used O
to O
have O
prior O
to O
his O
angioplasty. O
He O
took O
two O
sublingual O
nitroglycerins MEDICATION
and O
the O
pain O
was O
relieved O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
the O
second O
nitroglycerin O
tablet. O
At O
the O
time O
he O
was O
just O
sitting O
on O
his O
couch O
watching O
television. O
He O
has O
no O
history O
of O
exertional O
angina O
over O
the O
last O
several O
years. O
However, O
this O
complaint O
of O
chest O
pain O
at O
rest O
is O
very O
worrisome O
for O
unstable O
angina. O
He O
currently O
does O
not O
complain O
of O
any O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion, O
palpitation, O
or O
pre-syncope. O

his O

and O
maximize O
the O

After O
he O
has O
been O
on O
a O

for O
several O
days, O
we O
will O
perform O
an O
outpatient O

Dear O
Dr. O
Kirk: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient, O
Christopher O
Parrish, O
in O
follow O
up O
today. O
He O
is O
a O
71-year-old, O
right-handed O
man O
who O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Sutton O
Family O
Care O
on O
December O
29, O
2088 O
with O
left O
arm O
weakness, O
ataxia O
and O
dysarthria. O
The O
impression O
at O
that O
time O
was O
for O
lacunar O
stroke. O
An O
MRI O
showed O
a O
larger O
area O
of O
infarct O
in O
the O
right O
corona O
radiata. O
The O
patient O
had O
worsening O
weakness O
on O
the O
night O
of O
admission, O
despite O
being O
heparinized. O
The O
following O
day, O
he O
had O
a O
flaccid O
hemiparesis O
of O
the O
left O
side. O
Further O
workup O
included O
a O
magnetic O
resonance O
angiogram O
that O
showed O
irregularity O
of O
the O
proximal O
middle O
cerebral O
arteries O
bilaterally. O
There O
was O
no O
critical O
carotid O
stenosis. O
He O
had O
an O
embolic O
workup O
which O
consisted O
of O
an O
echocardiogram O
showing O
a O
preserved O
ejection O
fraction, O
dilated O
left O
atrium, O
very O
mild O
inferior O
hypokinesis, O
and O
no O
patent O
foramen O
ovale. O
He O
had O
a O
Holter O
monitor O
which O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
dysrhythmias. O
His O
cholesterol O
level O
was O
152 O
with O
an O
HDL O
of O
23. O
It O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
stroke O
was O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
atherosclerosis O
of O
the O
middle O
cerebral O
artery, O
involving O
either O
one O
or O
possibly O
several O
lenticulostriate O
arteries. O
He O
did O
not O
have O
any O
evidence O
of O
a O
flow O
limiting O
MCA O
stenosis. O
He O
had O
been O
on O
aspirin MEDICATION
prior, O
Plavix MEDICATION
was O
added O
to O
his O
regimen. O
Since O
his O
discharge O
from O
the O
hospital, O
he O
has O
been O
in O
rehabilitation O
for O
the O
last O
two O
months. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
weakness, O
numbness, O
tingling, O
ataxia, O
dysarthria, O
or O
dysphagia. O
He O
has O
no O
symptoms O
of O
aphasia. O
He O
has O
been O
left O
with O
some O
dysarthria O
from O
his O
initial O
event, O
which O
he O
feels O
has O
improved. O
I O
would O
agree O
with O
him. O
He O
also O
has O
regained O
some O
strength O
in O
the O
left O
leg, O
and O
is O
currently O
working O
on O
using O
a O
walker O
with O

Unfortunately, O
he O
has O
not O
regained O
any O
use O
of O
the O
left O
arm. O
He O
has O
not O
had O
any O

with O

He O
was O

I O
assume O
he O

still O
on O
this O

although O
he O
did O
not O

so. O
He O

The O
patient O
lives O
with O
a O

who O
works O
at O
Marble O
Slab O

The O
patient O
quit SMOKER
smoking SMOKER
15 SMOKER
years SMOKER
ago SMOKER
and O
only O
rarely O
drinks O
alcohol O
on O
social O
occasions. O
There O
is O
a O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
in O
his O
father O
and O
at O
least O
one O
of O
his O
brothers, O
but O
no O
family O
history O
of O
stroke. O
On O
examination, O
he O
was O
a O
pleasant O
gentleman O
in O
no O
apparent O
distress. O
His O
blood HYPERTENSION
pressure HYPERTENSION
was HYPERTENSION
150/90. HYPERTENSION
His O
language O
was O
intact. O
His O
speech O
was O
somewhat O
dysarthric, O
although O
this O
was O
improved O
from O
his O
admission. O
He O
was O
alert O
and O
oriented. O
His O
conversation O
was O
appropriate. O
The O
visual O
fields O
were O
full. O
The O
pupils O
were O
equal O
and O
reactive O
at O
4 O
mm. O
Facial O
sensation O
was O
normal. O
There O
was O
an O
upper O
motor O
neuron O
left O
facial O
droop. O
The O
tongue O
and O
palate O
were O
midline. O
The O
patient O
had O
0/5 O
flaccid O
hemiplegia O
of O
the O
left O
arm. O
There O
was O
atrophy O
of O
the O
left O
biceps. O
There O
was O
full O
range O
of O
motion O
of O
the O
joints. O
The O
patient O
had O
2/5 O
left O
iliopsoas, O
4+/5 O
hip O
extensors, O
3/5 O
left O
quadriceps, O
3/5 O
left O
ankle O
dorsiflexors, O
and O
3/5 O
ankle O
plantar O
flexors. O
The O
tone O
in O
the O
lower O
extremities O
was O
not O
increased. O
His O
right O
side O
was O
5/5. O
He O
had O
hyperreflexia O
of O
the O
left O
side O
and O
an O
equivocal O
toe. O
His O
right O
toe O
was O
downgoing. O
Sensation O
was O
intact O
to O
light O
touch O
and O
pinprick. O
I O
could O
not O
find O
any O
evidence O
to O
pinprick O
of O
his O
neuropathy. O
Vibration O
sense O
was O
very O
mildly O
reduced O
at O
the O
toes. O
He O
was O
in O
a O
wheelchair, O
and O
his O
gait O
was O
not O
assessed. O
Mr. O
Parrish's O
recovery O
is O
progressing. O
He O
has O
regained O
some O
strength O
in O
his O
left O
leg O
and O
his O
goal O
is O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
on O
his O
own O
with O
either O
a O
cane O
or O
walker. O
I O
hope O
that O
this O
will O
be O
the O
case. O
Unfortunately, O
his O
left O
arm O
has O
remained O
flaccid O
and O
he O
has O
no O
movement. O
I O
told O
him O
that O
his O
left O
arm O
will O
most O
likely O
remain O
with O
severe O
weakness. O
His O
stroke O
was O
most O
likely O
related O
to O
atheroma O
of O
the O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
and O
lenticulostriate O
arteries. O
I O
would O
encourage O
his O
blood O
pressure O
to O
be O
controlled, O
as O
has O
been O
done, O
and O
to O
continue O
an O
anticholesterol O
agent. O
I O
believe O
he O
has O
been O
on O
Gemfibrozil O
for O
a O
while. O
The O
literature O
suggests O
benefit O
for O
the O
statin O
drugs O
in O
primary O
prevention O
of O
stroke O
in O
patients O
with O
elevated O
cholesterol. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
gemfibrozil MEDICATION
has O
been O
studied O
in O
the O
same O
way. O
However, O
since O
he O
has O
been O
on O
this O
medicine O
so O
long, O
it O
may O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
continue O
using O
it O
if O
it O
is O
controlling O
his O
total O
cholesterol O
well. O
He O
should O
continue O
on O
an O
aspirin O
a O
day. O
He O
states O
that O
he O
is O
having O
difficulty O
obtaining O
Plavix O
due O
to O
the O
cost. O
I O
recommended O
to O
him O
that, O
in O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
Stroke O
Service O
at O
Sutton O
Family O
Care, O
patients O
in O
his O
situation O
do O
benefit O
from O
being O
on O
Plavix O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
after O
a O
stroke O
of O
this O
type. O
We O
recommended O
to O
him O
that O
he O
continue O
on O
Plavix O
for O
another O
six O
months O
because O
of O
this. O
This O
should O
give O
adequate O
time O
for O
any O
ulcerated O
or O
unstable O
plaque O
in O
his O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
to O
heal. O
After O
six O
months, O
if O
he O
has O
had O
no O
further O
clinical O
events, O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
his O
atheroma O
is O
stable O
and O
that O
he O
could O
be O
adequately O
treated O
with O
aspirin. O
I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
clinic O
in O
approximately O
six O
months. O
I O
will O
arrange O
for O
carotid O
noninvasives O
and O
anterior O
transcranial O
Dopplers O
to O
evaluate O
his O
carotid O
and O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
in O
approximately O
one O
year's O
time. O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
and O
examined O
by O
Dr. O
Laith O
Greene O
of O
the O
Sutton O
Family O
Care O
Stroke O

who O

Dear O
Dr. O
Ussery: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Russell O
Urban O
in O
Cardiology O
Clinic O
today. O
As O
you O
know, O
Mr. O
Urban O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
50-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
on O
July O
09, O
2093, O
while O
sitting O
at O
a O
concert O
in O
Central O
Park O
had O
the O
sudden O
onset O
of O
feeling O
unwell O
, O
epigastric O
discomfort, O
and O
profound O
diaphoresis. O
He O
came O
to O
the O
Worthington O
Regional O
Hospital O
Emergency O
Room O
at O
that O
time. O
By O
the O
time O
he O
arrived, O
his O
symptoms O
had O
abated. O
He O
had O
an O
unremarkable O
electrocardiogram O
initially O
and O
negative O
cardiac O
markers, O
and O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
medicine O
service O
to O
rule-out O
a O
myocardial CAD
infarction. CAD
That O
evening, O
he O
had O
recurrent O
symptoms O
and O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
sustained O
wide O
complex O
tachycardia, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
ventricular O
tachycardia. O
He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Cardiac O
Care O
Unit O
for O
further O
management. O
The O
next O
morning, O
he O
underwent O
cardiac O
ultrasound, O
which O
revealed O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
28% O
and O
a O
diffusely O
hypokinetic O
left O
ventricle O
with O
an O
akinetic O
inferior O
wall. O
Additionally O
his O
next O
set O
of O
cardiac CAD
markers CAD
returned CAD
positive. CAD
He O
therefore O
went O
cardiac CAD
catheterization CAD
revealing CAD
a CAD
total CAD
occlusion CAD
of CAD
his CAD
right CAD
coronary CAD
artery CAD
and CAD
minimal CAD
non-obstructive CAD
disease CAD
of CAD
the CAD
left CAD
system. CAD
This O
artery CAD
was CAD
stented CAD
with CAD
total CAD
of CAD
three CAD
stents CAD
(two CAD
Express CAD
stents CAD
2.5 CAD
x CAD
24 CAD
mm CAD
and CAD
one CAD
Pixel CAD
stent CAD
2.5 CAD
x CAD
28 CAD
mm), CAD
encompassing CAD
the CAD
entire CAD
length CAD
of CAD
the CAD
right CAD
coronary CAD
artery. CAD
A O
left O
ventriculogram O
was O
performed O
and O
demonstrated O
an O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
30% O
with O
a O
diffusely O
hypokinetic O
ventricle O
and O
and O
akinetic O
inferior O
wall. O
He O
ruled O
in O
for O
myocardial O
infarction O
with O
a O
peak O
CK O
of O
1490 O
and O
a O
peak O
troponin O
of O
2.0. O
A O
follow-up O
echocardiogram O
was O
performed O
on O
July O
15, O
2093. O
This O
study O
showed O
his O
ejection O
fraction O
had O
improved O
to O
36%; O
the O
left O
ventricle O
was O
diffusely O
hypokinetic O
and O
the O
inferior O
wall O
appeared O
severely O
hypokinetic. O
His O
reduced O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
his O
degree O
of O
coronary CAD
disease. CAD
Because O
of O
this, O
a O
series O
of O
laboratory O
tests O
were O
performed O
which O
revealed O
normal O
iron O
studies, O
normal O
thyroid O
function, O
and O
a O
normal O
serum O
protein O
electrophoresis O
pattern. O
He O
was O
discharged O
in O
stable O
condition O
to O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
as O
an O
outpatient. O
Since O
his O
myocardial O
infarction, O
Mr. O
Urban O
has O
been O
feeling O
quite O
well. O
He O
has O
returned O
to O
work O
in O
the O
factory O
where O
his O
employed O
as O
a O
manufacturing O
manager. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
symptoms O
of O
angina, O
dyspnea, O
nausea, O
or O
diaphoresis. O
He O
has O
felt O
very O
well. O
He O
continues O
to O
take O
his O
medications O
without O
difficulty, O
and O
denies O
any O
symptomatology O
whatsoever. O
His O
past O
medical O
history O
prior O
to O
this O
hospitalization O
is O
largely O
unremarkable O
because O
he O
had O
not O
sought O
medical O
care. O
Of O
note, O
he O
reports O
to O
me O
that O
about O
8 O
or O
9 O
years O
ago O
while O
living O
in O
Georgia, O
he O
presented O
to O
an O
emergency O
room O
with O
some O
chest O
discomfort. O
He O
was O
evaluated O
and O
released. O
He O
never O
had O
any O
further O
testing. O
He O
did O
not O
have O
a O
stress O
test, O
cardiac O
ultrasound O
or O
catheterization. O
Prior O
to O
his O
admission, O
he O
did O
not O
have O
any O
known O
hypertension HYPERTENSION
or O
hyperlipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
but O
has O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
these O
conditions O
while O
in O
the O
hospital. O
His O

His O
femoral O
pulses O
are O

Mr. O
Urban O
underwent O
a O
exercise O
treadmill O
test O
with O
sestamibi O
imaging O
yesterday. O
He O
exercised O
for O
10 O
minutes O
43 O
seconds O
achieving O
a O
maximum O
workload O
of O
12 O
METS, O
and O
a O
peak O
double O
product O
of O
21,600. O
His O
electrocardiogram O
was O
negative O
for O
ischemia. O
His O
nuclear O
images O
revealed O
a O
mild O
reduction O
in O
tracer O
activity O
in O
the O
inferior O
wall O
which O
persisted O
after O
reinjection O
consistent O
with O
his O
inferior O
myocardial O
infarction. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
ischemia O
elsewhere. O
His O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
measured O
at O
51%. O
In O
short, O
Mr. O
Urban O
is O
a O
51-year-old O
who O
had O
an O
inferior O
myocardial O
infarction, O
but O
interestingly O
during O
his O
hospitalization O
had O
systolic O
dysfunction O
well O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
his O
coronary O
disease. O
Also, O
his O
systolic O
function O
has O
improved O
over O
time. O
I O
think O
there O
are O
two O
processes O
going O
on. O
One O
is O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
Clearly O
this O
has O
manifested O
itself O
as O
an O
inferior O
myocardial O
infarction O
due O
to O
an O
occluded O
right O
coronary O
artery, O
which O
was O
treated O
during O
his O
hospitalization O
with O
stenting. O
The O
other O
issue O
is O
his O
transient O
systolic O
dysfunction O
that O
is O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
his O
coronary O
artery O
disease. O
Given O
the O
rapid O
improvement O
in O
his O
ejection O
fraction, O
I O
can O
only O
speculate O
as O
to O
the O
etiology O
of O
this. O
He O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
a O
persistent O
cardiomyopathy, O
but O
a O
transient O
one. O
I O
suspect O
that O
this O
is O
myocarditis. O
Unfortunatley, O
I O
have O
no O
way O
of O
proving O
this O
for O
certain O
but O
clinically O
it O
seems O
to O
fit. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
whatever O
led O
to O
his O
myocarditis O
also O
triggered O
his O
acute O
coronary O
syndrome. O
From O
the O
aspect O
of O
his O
coronary O
artery O
disease, O
he O
will O
continue O
on O
aspirin O
for O
life. O
He O
received O
quite O
a O
substantial O
amount O
of O
stenting O
to O
his O
right O
coronary O
artery, O
and O
I O
would O
opt O
to O
continue O
his O
Plavix O
for O
at O
least O
12 O
months. O
For O
his O
hyperlipidemia, O
I O
agree O
with O
Lipitor, O
and O
we O
will O
recheck O
his O
lipid O
profile O
to O
see O
if O
the O
dose O
of O
Lipitor O
is O
adequate. O
His O
LDL O
goal O
will O
be O
less O
than O
100. O
He O
is O
well O
beta-blocked O
on O
his O
carvedilol, O
and O
we O
will O
continue O
with O
the O
current O
dose O
of O
6.25 O
mg O
twice O
daily. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
allows O
us O
to O
increase O
his O
lisinopril O
from O
10 O
to O
15 O
mg O
daily. O
I O
will O
see O
Mr. O
Urban O
again O
in O
three O
months O
for O
followup. O
I O
will O
repeat O
his O
echocardiogram O
in O
six O
months' O
time O
to O
see O
where O
his O
ejection O
fraction O
has O
settled O
out. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
this O
very O
interesting O
and O
pleasant O
gentleman. O

Since O
his O
last O
visit O
with O
me, O
he O
has O
participated O
in O
and O
completed O
outpatient O
cardiac O
rehabilitation. O
He O
found O
this O
program O
to O
be O
very O
helpful; O
he O
sis O
very O
well O
with O
the O
program. O
He O
is O
currently O
exercising O
on O
a O

basis O
and O
has O
no O
chest O

He O
has O
stopped SMOKER
smoking. SMOKER
There O
have O
been O
no O
difficulties O
with O
his O
medications. O
On O
03/16/2094, O
he O
had O
a O
follow-up O
echocardiogram O
done; O
this O
study O
shows O
an O
LV O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
37% O
with O
septal O
hypokinesis O
and O
inferoposterior O
akinesis; O
there O
is O
trace O
mitral O
regurgitation; O
and O
aortic O
sclerosis, O
but O
no O

Notably, O
he O
has O
a O
right O
ventricular O
systolic O
pressure O
estimated O
to O
be O
46 O
mmHg O
with O
a O
right O
ventricle O
that O
is O
mildly O
dilated O
and O
mildly-to-moderately O
hypokinetic. O
He O
has O
been O
feeling O
quite O
well O
and O

Physical O
examination: O
He O
appears O
quite O
well O
and O
is O
in O
no O

His O
blood O

Impression: O
This O
is O
a O
50 O
year-old O
man O
with O
coronary CAD
disease CAD
who O
suffered O
an CAD
inferoposterior CAD
myocardial CAD
infarction CAD
in CAD
July CAD
2093. CAD
Additionally, O
he O
was O
also O
found O
to O
have O
cardiomyopathy CAD
with O
an O
LV O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
37 O
percent. O
He O
is O
currently O
asymptomatic O
from O
his O
coronary O
disease O
and O
his O
LV O
dysfunction. O
Notably, O
his O
last O
echocardiogram O
shows O
that O
he O
has O
increased O
RV O
systolic O
pressure O
and O
some O
early O
right O
ventricular O
dysfunction. O
The O
etiology O
of O
this O
right O
ventricular O
dysfunction O
is O
not O
clear. O
There O
is O
likely O
a O
component O
of O
left O
heart O
failure. O
In O
addition, O
he O
may O
have O
right O
heart O
failure O
out-of-proportion O
to O
left O
heart O
failure: O
he O
has O
a O
longstanding O
smoking O
history O
and O
may O
have O
a O
degree O
of O
COPD O
and, O
lastly, O
he O
may O
have O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea. O
He O
reports O
to O
me O
that O
he O
does O
snore O
at O
night, O
and O
his O
first O
wife O
in O
Georgia O
had O
told O
him O
for O
many O
years O
that O
during O
the O
night O
he O
had O
periods O
were O
he O
would O
stop O
breathing. O
This O
raises O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea O
as O
a O
consideration. O
Recommendations: O
Initially, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
start O
him O
on O
Lasix O
20 O
mg O
daily O
to O
lower O
his O
preload O
to O
help O
with O
any O
component O
of O
LV O
failure O
that O
is O
leading O
to O
this. O
The O
rest O
of O
his O
regimen O
is O
quite O
good, O
and O
I O
intend O
to O
continue O
them. O
To O
help O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
any O
component O
of O
cor O
pulmonale O
that O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
this, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
obtain O
first O
a O
chest O
x-ray, O
secondly O
a O
pulmonary O
function O
testing, O
and O
lastly O
a O
sleep O
study. O
If O
indeed O
we O
find O
components O
of O
obstructive O
lung O
disease O
or O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea, O
we O
will O
have O
him O
see O
a O
pulmonologist O
and O
treat O
these O
accordingly. O
I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
six O
months' O
time. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
this O
pleasant O
gentleman. O

at O
that O
time, O
jailing O
the O
RV O
marginal O
with O
sluggish O

afterward. O
Post O
MI O
ECHO O
showed O
EF O
of O
36% O
w/diffuse O

He O
underwent O
f/u O
ETT O
w/imaging O
in O
8/93 O
which O
showed O
a O
small O
fixed O
inferior O
defect O
with O
considerable O
residual O

noted O
some O
chest CAD
tightness CAD
and O
SOB O
similar O
in O
quality O
to O
his O
prior O
angina, CAD
but O
markedly O
less O
severe, O
which O
occurred O
with O

He O
had O
a O

EKG CAD
was CAD
positive CAD
for CAD
ischemia. CAD
Imaging O
showed O
a O

Dear O

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O

Mr. O

today. O
As O

a O
78-year-old O

and O
a O
significant O

He O
is O
likely O

for O

and O
I O
spent O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
time O
explaining O
why O
stenting O
his O
situation O
would O
be O
less O
satisfactory. O
I O
will O
obtain O

Overall, O
I O
am O

the O

relief O
from O

I O
would O

Booked O
for O
CPE, O
but O
current O
symptoms O
took O
precedence. O
Pt O
presents O
very O
discouraged O
over O
escalating O
Lasix O
doses O
and O
persistant O
problems O
with O
reccurent O
edema O
and O
cough, O
each O
time O
relieved O
by O
increasing O
diuretics, O
so O
ACEI MEDICATION
cough O
seems O
unlikely. O
Avoiding O
all O
salt O
in O
diet O
with O
good O
compliance. O
Did O
see O
sleep O
lab O
tech, O
tried O
new O
settings O
and O
mask O
on O
new O
machine, O
but O
still O
tolerates O
poorly. O
When O
discussed O
in O
some O
detail, O
notes O
feelings O
of O
suffocation O
with O
wearing O
mask O
for O
any O
period O
of O
time. O
Also O
notes O
sense O
of O
being O
tied O
down O
frrom O
mask O
very O
difficult O
to O
tolerate. O
Without O
exploring O
details O
greatly, O
we O
discussed O
potential O
role O
of O
PTSD O
in O
precipitating O
symptoms O
related O
to O
mask O
use, O
and O
potentially O
the O
effect O
of O
nocturnal O
hypoxia O
and O
RV O
strain O
on O
accumulation O
of O
fluid. O
Improving O
tolerance O
of O
CPAP O
seems O
very O
key. O
Pt O
has O
started O
atkins O
dt O
with O
good O
success O
(6# O
in O
first O
week), O
and O
improving O
BGs O
are O
requiring O
reduction O
in O
insulin, MEDICATION
which O
is O
great. O
so O
it O
seems O
that O
addressing O
OSA O
is O
the O
key O
to O
improving O
overall O
status O
now. O
We O
discussed O
some O
options...Including O
potential O
for O
tracheostomy O
to O
fix O
this O
without O
having O
to O
address O
mask, O
but O
agreed O
to O
try O
to O
initiate O
trial O
of O
CBT O
to O
see O
if O
we O
can O
improve O
mask O
talerance O
with O
symptom O
reduction. O
He O
remains O
quite O
clear O
that O
he O
has O
no O
interest O
in O
furhter O
'exploring' O
the O
PTSD O
history, O
and O
I O
reassured O
him O
that O
CBT O
does O
not O
require O
doing O
this. O
OSA: O
Likely O
has O
near O
optimal O
mask O
set O
up O
now...We'll O
explore O
potential O
for O
CBT O
with O
sleep O
center O
or O
perhaps O
cardiac O
rehab O
source. O
Hopefully O
this O
would O
address O
fluid O

to O

greater O

as O

here. O
LABORATORY O
EVALUATION: O
Finger O
stick O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
was O
160. O
Electrocardiogram O
shows O
some O
PR O
depressions O
in O
multiple O
leads. O
No O
significant O
ST O
elevations. O
THERAPY O
RENDERED/COURSE O
IN O
ED: O
Impression O
is O
this O
patient O
is O
a O
68 O
year O
old O
female O
with O
planned O
cystoscopy O
today O
who O
passed O
out O
on O
the O
premises. O
A O
code O
was O
called O
overhead. O
Bystanders O
reported O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
diaphoretic. O
They O
gave O
her O
something O
to O
drink. O
Her O
blood O
sugar O
here O
was O
within O
normal O
limits. O
The O
patient O
has O
no O
complaints O
of O
chest O
pain O
or O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
She O
looks O
well O
but O
does O
have O
PR O
depressions O
on O
electrocardiogram O
but O
has O
no O
rubs O
or O
gallops O
on O
her O
electrocardiogram. O
The O
patient O
was O
made O
NPO O
because O
of O
her O
cystoscopy O
procedure. O
FINAL O
DIAGNOSES: O
1. O
Syncopal O
episode O
versus O
presyncope O
from O
the O
taking O
of O
her O
diabetes O
medicine O
this O
morning. O
2. O
PR O
depression O
on O
electrocardiogram O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
new. O
No O
old O
electrocardiogram O
to O
compare. O
We O
need O
to O
address O
the O
PR O
depressions. O
This O
is O
possibly O
pericarditis O
but O
it O
is O
unlikely. O
I O
would O
think O
that O
this O
more O
likely O
ischemia O
than O
pericarditis. O
3. O
Cardiac O
ischemia. O
DISPOSITION O
(including O
condition O
upon O
discharge): O
The O
patient O
will O
need O
admission O
and O
a O
formal O
rule O
out. O
She O
may O
even O
need O
an O
echocardiogram O
inpatient. O
A O
full O
work O
up O
is O
pending. O
The O
patient's O
full O
disposition O
is O
pending O
and O
she O
was O
signed O
out O
to O
Dr. O
Aleta O
Nunley O
at O

but O
only O
benign O
hemangiomas O
were O
found. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O

in O
mid O
September. O
She O
required O
at O

two O
more O
admissions O
from O

to O
San O

over O
the O
next O
two O
months. O
She O
apparently O
had O
severe O
gastroparesis O
and O
was O
unable O
to O
eat, O
requiring O
portacath O
for O
TPN O
around O
October O
10. O
She O

breast O

and O
DVTs O
who O
presents O
following O
a O
syncopal O
episode O
on O
the O
day O
of O
admission. O
Per O
a O
note O
from O
her O
neurologist, O
Dr. O
Gary O
Keyes, O
Ms. O
Yandell O
has O
a O
history O
of O
transient O
neurologic O
events, O
consisting O
of O
right O
hand O
numbness O
and O
weakness, O
in O
2098 O
and O
2099. O
She O
had O
an O
extensive O
workup O
in O
which O
it O
was O
unclear O
whether O
these O
represented O
a O
transient O
ischemic O
attack O
or O
partial O
seizures. O
She O
was O
started O
on O
Depakote O
for O
this. O
Between O
March O
and O
April O
of O
2102 O
her O
Depakote O
was O
weaned O
because O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
interval O
seizures. O
EEG O
in O
January O
2102 O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
epileptiform O
activity. O
In O
July O
2102 O
she O
had O
several O
episodes O
of O
loss O
of O
consciousness O
which O
ultimately O
were O
diagnosed O
as O
syncope. O
Dr. O
Keyes O
witnessed O
one O
of O
these O
events O
in O
his O
office O
in O
7/02 O
and O
it O
was O
associated O
with O
hypotension. O
Ms. O
Yandell O
s O
family O
describes O
her O
syncopal O
events O
differently, O
stating O
that O
she O
will O
stare O
into O
space O
for O
5-8 O
minutes, O
during O
which O
time O
she O
is O
unresponsive. O
When O
she O
wakes O
up, O
she O
is O
confused O
and O
sleepy O
for O
~ O
20 O
minutes O
and O
will O
often O
have O
nausea O
and O
vomiting. O
These O
episodes O
are O
associated O
with O
jaw-clenching, O
but O
no O
tonic-clonic O
movements. O
Ms. O
Yandell O
does O
state O
that O
she O
feels O
dizzy O
and O
lightheaded O
before O
these O
events, O
and O
reports O
that O
her O
family O
says O
she O
looks O
pale O
and O
clammy. O
She O
does O
not O
recall O
the O
events O
herself. O
The O
family O
does O
not O
report O
loss O
of O
bowel O
or O
bladder O
incontinence, O
although O
the O
patient O
did O
apparently O
lose O
continence O
of O
bowel O
shortly O
after O
being O
admitted O
(unclear O
circumstances O
surrounding O
this). O
The O
family O
reports O
that O
EMS O
checked O
her O
blood O
sugar O
on O
the O
scene O
it O
was O
normal. O
In O

for O
nausea, O
ASA, MEDICATION
and O
IVF, O
and O
was O
transferred O
up O
to O
the O
floor O
for O
further O
management. O
The O
patient O
denies O
that O
the O
episodes O
occur O
after O
she O
rises O
from O
a O
sitting O
position. O
Do O
not O
occur O
when O
bearing O
down, O
or O
when O
she O
is O
exerting O
herself. O
The O
episodes O
are O
not O
sudden O
she O
appears O
to O
have O
some O
warning O
before O
one O
occurs. O
She O
denies O
fevers/chills. O
No O
chest O
pain, O
palpitations. O
Some O
shortness O
of O
breath O
when O
walking, O
which O
sounds O

Has O
had O
a O

for O
a O

it O

AND O
RECOMMENDATIONS: O
DOE O
is O
likely O
multifactorial. O
It O
may O
be O
beneficial O
to O
separate O
cardiac O
from O
pulmonary O
limitatio O
from O
deconditioning O
and O
I O
recommended O
a O
cardio-pulmonary O
exercise O
test O
to O
the O
patient, O
to O
which O
she O
agreed. O
In O
addition, O
as O
previously O
discussed, O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
pulmonary O
rehab. O
Finally, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
much O
asthma O
is O
contributing O
to O
the O
picture. O
There O
was O
no O
response O
to O
brnonchodialtor O
today O
and O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
feel O
any O
help O
from O
it O
either. O
I O
told O
her O
that O
she O
does O
not O
need O
to O
use O
albuterol O
if O
it O
doesn't O
help O
her. O
I've O
requested O
RAST O
allergy O
testing O
to O
further O
investigate O
the O
possiblity O
of O
allergic O
asthma. O
We O
will O
not O
do O
the O
methacholine O
challange O
testing O
due O
to O
patient's O
already O
deacreased O
FEV1 O
(due O
to O
restriction) O
as O
it O
might O
be O
dangerous O
to O
precipitate O
bronchoconstriciton O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
an O
already O
limited O
reserve. O

Re: O

Dear O
Matt: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Potts O
in O
follow O
up O
today. O
As O
you O
know, O
he O
recently O
had O
a O
complicated O
hospital O
course. O
He O
underwent O
cardiac CAD
catheterization, CAD
which CAD
revealed CAD
serial CAD
stenoses CAD
of CAD
the CAD
LAD CAD
including CAD
70% CAD
and CAD
90% CAD
stenoses. CAD
The O
first O
marginal O
branch O
had O
a O
60% O
ostial O
stenosis. O
The O
right O
coronary O
artery O
had O
60 O
and O
80% O
stenoses, O
respectively. O
The O
PDA O
had O
a O
70% O
narrowing. O
Given O
his O
very O
significant O
wish O
not O
to O
have O
bypass O
surgery, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
proceed O
with O
angioplasty CAD
of CAD
the CAD
right CAD
coronary CAD
artery CAD
as CAD
well CAD
as CAD
the CAD
obtuse CAD
marginal. CAD
It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
LAD O
was O
a O
small O
vessel, O
and O
not O
worth O
going O
after O
at O
this O
time. O
The O
RCA CAD
was CAD
successfully CAD
stented, CAD
but O
was O
complicated O
by O
occlusion O
of O
the O
posterior O
left O
ventricular O
branch. O
By O
the O
end O
of O
the O
procedure, O
flow O
had O
been O
restored O
to O
some O
degree O
to O
the O
posterior O
left O
ventricular O
branch, O
but O
Mr. O
Potts O
rule CAD
in CAD
for CAD
a CAD
small CAD
subendocardial CAD
myocardial CAD
infarction. CAD
Due O
to O
the O
closure O
of O
the O
left O
posterior O
ventricular O
branch, O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O
branch O
was O
not O
dilated. O
Mr. O
Potts O
underwent O
two O
exercise O
tests O
post O
procedure. O
The O
second O
exercise O
test O
was O
performed O
with O
MIBI O
imaging. O
He O
exercised O
for O
nine O
minutes O
on O
a O
submaximal O
Bruce O
protocol, O
and O
experienced O
chest CAD
pain. CAD
He O
had O
a O
maximal O
blood O
pressure O
of O
148/72 O
and O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
121. O
MIBI CAD
images CAD
revealed CAD
a CAD
small CAD
nontransmural CAD
myocardial CAD
infarction CAD
of CAD
the CAD
basal CAD
1/3 CAD
of CAD
the CAD
inferior CAD
wall. CAD
There CAD
was CAD
moderate CAD
to CAD
severe CAD
ischemia CAD
of CAD
the CAD
inferolateral CAD
territory CAD
in CAD
the CAD
territory CAD
of CAD
the CAD
RCA. CAD
Given O
these O
findings, O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
that O
Mr. O
Potts O
undergo O
bypass O
surgery. O

Of O
note O
is O
that O
Mr. O

has O
been O

a O

recently. O
His O

He O
is O
having O
difficulty O
arranging O
the O
appropriate O
insurance O
to O
cover O
her O
medications. O
Mr. O
Potts O
has O
been O
experiencing O
chest O
pain O
since O
discharge. O
This O
occurs O
with O
increased O
activity, O
and O
is O
relief O
with O
either O
rest O
and/or O
1 O
nitroglycerin. MEDICATION
He O
has O
decreased O
his O
work O
level O
considerably, O
and O
is O
relatively O
sedentary. O
On O
physical O
exam, O
he O
was O
well O
appearing O
and O
in O
no O
distress. O
He O
had O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
112/70, O
with O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
60. O
His O
weight O
was O
203 O
pounds. O
Chest O
was O
clear O
to O
auscultation O
and O
percussion. O
Cardiac O
exam O
revealed O
a O
flat O
JVP O
of O
30 O
degrees, O
a O
nondisplaced O
PMI O
with O
a O
normal O
S1 O
and O
S2, O
without O
murmurs, O
rubs, O
or O
gallops. O
Carotids O
are O
2+ O
bilaterally O
without O
bruits. O
His O
abdomen O
is O
soft, O
nontender. O
There O
is O
no O
organomegaly, O
and O
no O
hepatojugular O
reflux. O
Extremities O
are O
without O
edema. O
Electrocardiogram O
reveals O
a O
normal O

with O
a O
rate O
of O
61. O
Intervals O
are O
.16/.08/.42, O
with O

AVF. O
I O
did O
not O

Therefore, O
Mr. O
Potts O
returns O
today O
still O
experiencing O
angina CAD
with O
mild O
exertion. O
He O
has O
agreed O
to O
undergo O

good O
case O
for O
this. O
There O
has O
been O
precedent O
for O
those O
who O
have O
had O
bypass O
surgery O
to O
return O
to O
work O
as O
an O
actor. O
Given O
Mr. O
Potts's O
current O
feeling, O
I O
will O
make O
an O
appointment O
with O
Dr. O
Earl O
Jacob O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
for O
him O
to O
be O
seen O
prior O
to O
scheduling O
bypass O
surgery. O
It O
is O
somewhat O
worrisome O
that O
Mr. O
Potts O
will O
be O
caring O
for O
his O
89- O
year-old O
mother O
at O
home, O
along O
with O
his O
wife. O
His O
mother O
currently O
uses O
a O
walker, O
and O
I O
have O
warned O
Mr. O
Potts O
that O
he O
really O
cannot O
exert O
himself O
to O
any O
great O
degree O
in O
terms O
of O
helping O
his O
mother O
in O
the O
house. O
He O
understands O
this, O
and O
if O
his O
chest O
pain O
should O
become O
more O
frequent, O
intense, O
or O
prolonged, O
he O
will O
immediately O
call O
me. O
If O
Mr. O
Potts O
is O
not O
scheduled O
for O
surgery, O
I O
will O
see O
him O
in O
two O
weeks O
at O
NDNH. O

#129-53-47-3 O
Dear O
Philip: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Shilpa O
Pickett O
in O
Cardiovascular O
Clinic O
today. O
Since O
her O
discharge O
from O
the O
hospital O
in O
September, O
she O
has O
noticed O
that O
she O
is O
fatigue O
with O
exertion O
but O
has O
had O
no O
chest O
pressure O
and O
no O
exertional O
diaphoresis, O
nausea, O
or O
jaw O
pain. O
She O
does O
note O
occasional O
lightheadedness O
throughout O
the O
day, O
this O
is O
not O
related O
to O
position O
or O
going O
from O
sitting O
to O
standing O
position. O
As O
you O
are O
aware, O
her O
MIBI O
test O
showed O
very O
small O
amount O
of O
ischemia O
almost O
undetectable O
in O
amount. O
Her O
medical O
regimen O
includes O
Lasix O
40 O

and HYPERTENSION
left HYPERTENSION
arm HYPERTENSION
seated, HYPERTENSION
heart O
rate O
is O
77 O
and O
irregular, O
respiratory O
rate O
is O
12. O
There O
is O
no O
increase O
in O
jugular O
venous O
pressure. O
Carotids O
are O
free O
of O
bruits. O
Lungs O
are O
clear O
to O
auscultation O
throughout. O
Cardiac O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
distant O
heart O
sounds O
with O
no O
S3, O
S4. O
Abdomen O
is O
soft O
and O
nontender. O
The O
extremities O
are O
free O
of O
edema. O
Electrocardiogram O
is O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
left O
bundle O
branch O

unchanged O
from O
prior O

In O
summary, O
Shilpa O
Pickett O
certainly O
has O
cardiovascular O
risk O
factors O
of O
sedentary O
lifestyle, O
diabetes, DIABETES
high HYPERLIPIDEMIA
cholesterol HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
increase O
in O
weight. O
We O
will O
be O
rechecking O
her O
lipid O
profile O
today. O
She O
reports O
to O
me O
that O
she O
has O
absolutely O
no O
appetite O
for O
the O
foods O
she O
usually O
eats O
and O
has O
occasionally O
had O
trouble O
eating. O
She O
notes O
no O
dysphoria O
and O
no O
other O
signs O
or O
symptoms O
of O
depression. O
She O
has O
had O
no O
change O
in O
her O
hair O
or O

moment, O
I O
will O
be O
reviewing O
her O
SMA O

for O
evidence O
of O
liver O
dysfunction O
but O
would O
strongly O
consider O
both O
depression O
and O
hyperthyroidism O
for O
further O

of O
this O
loss O
of O
appetite. O
It O
is O
certainly O
a O

for O
me O
to O

CHIEF O
COMPLAINT: O
Ms. O
Pickett O
comes O
to O
the O
Easley O
Baptist O
Hospital O
with O
numerous O
complaints. O
HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
She O
states O
that O
she O
has O
not O
been O
feeling O
well O
since O
her O
upper O
respiratory O
tract O
infection. O
She O
had O
the O
flu O
in O
January O
and O
then O
developed O
another O
upper O
respiratory O
tract O
infection O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago. O
She O
states O
that O
this O
has O
severely O
debilitated O
her. O
She O
is O
complaining O
of O
occasional O
nonproductive O
cough, O
post O
nasal O
drip, O
and O
occasional O
dull O
headache. O
However, O
her O
main O
concern O
is O
her O
stomach O
and O
her O
back. O
Ms. O
Pickett O
continues O
to O
have O
postprandial O
nausea O
and O
discomfort O
in O
her O
epigastrium, O
particularly O
after O
eating. O
This O
is O
different O
than O
her O
reflux O
disease, O
which O
she O
feels O
is O
under O
fairly O
good O
control, O
with O
the O
Prilosec-Propulsid O
combination. O
She O
is O
describing O
some O
anorexia, O
although O
she O
has O
not O
lost O
any O
weight. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
any O
alterations O
in O
her O
bowel O
movements. O
She O
has O
not O
been O
constipated O
or O
had O
diarrhea. O
She O
wonders O
whether O
this O
could O
be O
in O
gallbladder. O
In O
addition, O
she O
is O
continuing O
to O
have O
some O
back O
pain O
with O
radiation O
down O
her O
left O
leg O
in O
the O
L5/S1 O
distribution. O
She O
had O
one O
epidural O

but O
was O
due O
to O

back. O
Given O
her O
upper O
respiratory O
tract O
infection, O
this O
was O
postponed. O
She O
is O
not O
having O
any O
heart O
symptoms O
or O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
Her O
sugars O
have O
been O
under O
good O
control, O
ranging O
between O

143. O
Her O
blood HYPERTENSION

is HYPERTENSION
152/70 HYPERTENSION
today, O
with O
a O
pulse O
of O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
physical O
exam, O
lungs O
were O
clear O
to O
auscultation. O
There O
was O
no O
JVD. O
Heart: O
regular O
rate O
and O
rhythm O
with O
positive O
S4, O
? O
S3 O
with O
no O
significant O
murmur. O
Abdomen O
was O
soft, O
nondistended, O
with O
some O
mild O
tenderness O
without O
rebound O
or O
guarding O
over O
the O
right O
upper O
quadrant. O
Abdomen O
was O
somewhat O
bloated O
per O
patient O
and O
diffusely O
tender. O
Extremities O
revealed O
some O
mild O
pedal O
edema O
left O
greater O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
A O
seventy-one-year-old O
woman O
with O
multiple O
medical O
issues, O
including O
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease, CAD
CHF, O
diabetes, DIABETES
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
and O
cerebrovascular O
disease. O
She O
came O
in O
today O
for O
discussion O
of O
her O
ongoing O
lumbar O
radiculopathic O
pain O
as O
well O
as O
her O
abdominal O
complaint. O
With O
regard O
to O
her O
back O
pain, O
she O
wanted O
a O
prescription O
for O
Tylenol O
with O
codeine, O
which O
has O
helped O
in O
the O
past. O
I O
gave O
her O
a O
prescription. O
I O
warned O
her O
about O
the O
possible O
side O
effects O
of O
constipation. O
She O
should O
contact O
the O
pain O
clinic O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
feels O
able, O
for O
a O
repeat O
epidural O
steroid O
injection. O
With O
regard O
to O
her O
abdominal O
complaints, O
the O
bubbling O
in O
her O
chest, O
postprandial O
nausea O
and O
anorexia O
could O
certainly O
be O
due O
to O
gallbladder O
disease. O
Unclear O
contribution O
from O
her O
reflux. O
Dr. O
Mario O
Robison O
recommended O
elective O
cholecystectomy. O
Given O
the O
fact O
that O
Ms. O
Pickett O
is O
being O
more O
and O
more O
bothered O
by O
these O
symptoms, O
it O
may O
be O

I O

asked O
her O
to O
call O
Dr. O

and O
make O
an O
appointment O
to O
discuss O
her O
cardiovascular O

She O
is O
otherwise O
up O
to O
date O
with O
her O
issues O
and O
doing O
relatively O
well O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
and O
diabetic O
perspective. O
She O
would O
probably O
do O
better O
with O
lower O
blood O
pressure. O
We O
could O
consider O
increasing O
her O
Imdur. O
I O
plan O
to O
follow O
up O
with O
her O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
time. O

of O
health O
until O
about O
2 O
weeks O

when O
she O
began O
to O
have O
episodes O
of O
chest O
discomfort. O
She O
has O
only O
had O
two O
such O
episodes O
until O
the O
morning O
of O

There O
was O
also O
poor O
R-wave O

clearly O
has O
evidence O
of O
an O
inferoposterior O
MI O
initially O
with O
a O
very O
high O
filling O
pressure O
and O
pulmonary O
edema O
and O
mitral O
regurgitation. O
She O
has O
had O
her O
circumflex, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
large O
vessel, O
well O
treated O
now O
with O
a O
drug-eluting O
stent, O
and O
her O
wedge O
has O
come O
down, O
and O
her O
mitral O
regurgitation O
is O
substantially O
improved. O
At O
this O
point, O
we O
will O
bring O
her O
to O
the O
coronary O

unit O
for O
careful O
management O
with O
aspirin, MEDICATION
Plavix, MEDICATION
heparin, O
continue O
the O
Integrilin, O
as O
well O
as O
Lasix O
and O
nitrates. MEDICATION
We O
will O
plan O
to O
initiate O
afterload O
reduction O
as O
soon O
as O
tolerated, O
and O
also O
plan O
beta-blockade O
to O
limit O
her O
myocardial O
oxygen O

She O
certainly O
has O
co-existent O
quite O
substantial CAD
coronary CAD
disease CAD
including O
primarily O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
degree O
and O
to O
some O
degree O
the O
LAD. O
At O
this O
point, O
if O
she O
were O
to O
have O
developed O
recurrent O
ischemia, O
we O
would O
proceed O
to O
consideration O
of O
bypass O
surgery. O

RE: O

Dear O
Vester: O
Mrs. O
Vance O
presents O
to O
the O
office O
today O
for O
general O
cardiac O
evaluation. O
As O
her O
history O
is O
well O
known O
to O
you, O
I O
will O
repeat O
it O
briefly O
for O
our O
records. O
Mrs. O
Vance O
is O
a O
47-year-old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
variegata O
porphyria, O
insulin DIABETES
dependent DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES
and O
significant O
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease. CAD
In O
2061, O
after O
a O
four O
to O
five O
day O
history O
of O
retrosternal O
chest O
discomfort, O
she O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Barton O
Memorial O
Hospital O
where O
coronary O
angiography O
revealed O
a O
95% O
proximal O
left O
anterior O
descending O
artery O
stenosis. O
She CAD
underwent CAD
balloon CAD
angioplasty CAD
of CAD
her CAD
LAD CAD
times CAD
two CAD
with CAD
inadequate CAD
results. CAD
She CAD
therefore CAD
was CAD
taken CAD
electively CAD
for CAD
coronary CAD
artery CAD
bypass CAD
graft CAD
surgery CAD
with CAD
placement CAD
of CAD
a CAD
left CAD
internal CAD
mammary CAD
artery CAD
to CAD
her CAD
LAD. CAD
She O
subsequently O
continued O
to O
have O
chest O
discomfort O
and O
underwent O
repeat O
cardiac O
catheterization O
in O
May O
of O
2063 O
at O
which O
time O
coronary O
angiography O
revealed O
a O
60% O
stenosis O
in O
the O
proximal O
left O
anterior O
descending O
artery O
and O
a O
50% O
stenosis O
in O
the O
mid O
right O
coronary O
artery. O
The O
catheterization O
report O
does O
not O
indicate O
the O
status O
of O
her O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
graft. O
Since O
then, O
she O
has O
continued O
to O
have O
episodes O
of O
intermittent O
abdominal O
discomfort. O
She O
recently O
has O
undergone O
an O
extensive O
evaluation O
by O
the O
gastroenterology O
service O
for O
her O
abdominal O
pain O
without O
specific O
pathology O
being O
discovered. O
Trials O
of O
H2 O
blockers O
and O
proton O
pump O
inhibitors O
have O
been O
ineffective. O
In O
November O
of O
2068, O
she O
underwent O
a O
Bruce O
protocol O
stress O
test O
exercising O
for O
eight O
minutes O
to O
a O
peak O
heart O
rate O
of O
131, O
peak O
blood O
pressure O
of O
188/82 O
stopping O
because O
of O
fatigue. O
She O
had O
no O
ischemic O
changes O
on O
electrocardiogram. O
Over O
the O
past O
two O
weeks O
however, O
she O
has O
noticed O
that O
her O
chronic O
abdominal O
pain O
syndrome O
(which O
she O
often O
describes O
as O
feeling O
like O
indigestion) O
now O
includes O
radiation O
to O
her O
left O
shoulder. O
The O
pain O
is O
not O
exacerbated O
by O
position, O
time O
of O
day O
or O
any O
particular O
activity. O
The O
pain O
does O
not O
awaken O
her O
from O
sleep O
nor O
does O
it O
occur O
at O
rest. O
Of O
note, O
her O
lipid O
profile O
from O
October O
2068 O
indicates O
a O
cholesterol O
of O

She O
has O
had O
a O

for O
the O
past O
several O
years O
and O
her O
most O
recent O
stress O
test O
approximately O
one O

did O
not O
show O
significant O
provokable O
ischemia. O
Nonetheless, O
I O
am O
concerned O
that O
her O
clinical O
presentation O
may O
still O
represent O
recurrent O
ischemia. O
I O
therefore O
have O
scheduled O
her O
for O
an O
exercise O
MIBI O
stress O
test O
and O
I O
will O
obtain O
both O
an O

and O

studies. O
In O
light O
of O
her O
significant O
dyslipidemia O
and O
insulin O
dependent O
diabetes, O
I O
strongly O
recommend O
beginning O
aggressive O
antilipemic O
pharmacologic O
therapy. O
Unless O
her O
variegata O
porphyria O
precludes O
the O
use O
of O
atorvastatin, O
I O
would O
begin O
this O
at O
10 O
mg O
po O
q.d. O
I O
would O
target O
her O
LDL O
cholesterol O
to O
less O

90. O
In O
addition, O
I O
have O
started O
her O
on O
atenolol O
at O
25 O
mg O
po O
q.d. O
and O
I O
would O
consider O
beginning O
an O

that O
I O
would O

her O

Dear O
Wanda: O
Mr. O
Vance O
returns O
for O
followup. O
Since O
last O
seen, O
she O
apparently O
was O
recently O
seen O
in O
the O
walk-in O
clinic O
in O
your O
office O
complaining O
of O
profound O
fatigue O
and O
depression. O
She O
wonders O
if O
she O
was O
having O
a O
flare O
of O
her O
porphyria. O
Apparently, O
her O
examination O
at O
that O
time O
was O
relatively O
benign, O
and O
no O
specific O
new O
findings O
were O
noted. O
After O
talking O
with O
Dr. O
Vogt O
at O
that O
office O
visit, O
she O
felt O
modestly O
improved, O
and O
over O
the O
past O
few O
weeks O
feels O
that O
her O
energy O
level O
has O
returned O
to O
its O
baseline. O
Lab O
studies O
obtained O
at O
that O
time O
revealed O
creatinine O
0.9, O
glucose O
elevated O
at O
236, O
hematocrit O
of O
43, O
with O
a O
white O
count O

As O
no O
specific O
pathology O
was O
noted, O
she O
was O
sent O
home O
without O
any O
change O
in O
her O
medical O

Carotids O
are O

with O
very O

radiating O
from O

and O
a O

murmur O
radiating O
from O
the O
apex O
to O
the O

No O
significant O

or O

The O
abdomen O
is O
benign. O
Extremities O
reveal O
trace O
bipedal O
edema. O
Peripheral O
pulses O
are O
diminished O
but O
detectable. O
Electrocardiogram O
is O
pending. O
Impression: O
Ms. O
Vance O
remains O
relatively O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
perspective. O
However, O
as O
you O
know, O
her O
last O
echocardiogram O
did O
show O
evidence O
of O
at O
least O
moderate O
mitral O
regurgitation O
with O
significantly O
reduced O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
function. O
She O
has O
made O
it O
quite O
clear O
that O
under O
no O
circumstances O
would O
she O
consider O
repeat O
cardiac O
surgery O
to O
treat O
her O
valvular O
heart O
disease. O
Nonetheless, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
helpful O
for O
her O
to O
undergo O
repeat O
echocardiogram O
to O
help O
gauge O
the O
current O
status O
of O
her O
left O
ventricle O
and O
degree O
of O
regurgitation, O
which O
may O
allow O
for O
additional O
modifications O
to O
her O
therapeutic O
regimen. O
Beyond O
this, O
her O
condition O
is O
actually O
relatively O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
standpoint. O
I O
have O
not O
further O
altered O
her O
medical O
regimen. O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O
her O
care. O
Sincerely O
yours, O

Dear O
Dr. O
Fernandes: O
Dr. O
Nunes O
and O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
to O
see O
your O
patient, O
Mr. O
Christian O
Mullen, O
this O
morning O
in O
the O
office O
for O
a O
routine O
vascular O
followup. O
It O
has O
been O
nearly O
18 O
months O
since O
his O
last O
visit O
here O
and O
in O
the O
interim O
time, O
has O
been O
having O
discomfort O
involving O
both O
of O
his O
hips, O
thighs, O
and O
calves. O
As O
you O
well O
know, O
Mr. O
Mullen O
is O
a O
delightful O
69-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
history O
of O
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
hyperlipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease, CAD
type DIABETES
2 DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES
mellitus, DIABETES
and O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
who O
previously O
underwent O
left O
common O
femoral O
and O
left O
popliteal O
artery O
revascularization O
November O
2088 O
followed O
by O
right O
external, O
right O
internal, O
and O
right O
common O
femoral O
artery O
revascularization O
in O
February O
2089. O
Despite O
the O
technical O
success O
of O
both O
procedures, O
he O
continued O
to O
have O
bilateral O
hip O
claudication O
symptoms. O
When O
we O
had O
last O
evaluated O
him O
in O
November O
2089, O
we O
had O
considered O
moving O
forward O
with O
CT O
angiography O
to O
assess O
the O
patency O
of O
his O
aorto-iliac O
anatomy. O
At O
the O
time, O
he O
favored O
moving O
on O
a O
conservative O
course O
with O
improved O
walking O
regimen O
and O
weight O
loss. O
Unfortunately, O
despite O
these O
measures, O
he O
feels O
quite O
disabled O
and O
limited O
by O
his O
claudication O
symptoms. O
Symptoms O
are O
noticeable O
between O
20 O
and O
50 O
yards O
distance O
occurring O
in O
the O
hip O
area O
as O
well O
as O
extending O
down O
in O
to O
his O
thigh O
and O
occasionally O
the O
calves. O
Symptoms O
resolve O
with O
sitting O
and O
resting O
for O
approximately O
2.5 O
minutes. O
He O
notes O
that O
symptoms O
will O
improve O
with O
standing O
still O
however O
sitting O
symptoms O
resolve O
much O
quicker. O
He O
does O
not O
necessarily O
notice O
any O
change O
with O
inclines O
or O
going O
up O
stairs; O
in O
fact, O
he O
is O
actually O
able O
to O
climb O
18 O
stairs O
to O
his O
office O
without O
limitation. O
From O
the O
cardiac O
perspective, O
Mr. O
Mullen O
has O
been O
free O
of O
any O
symptoms O
of O
exertional O
chest O
tightness, O
pressure, O
or O
shortness O
of O

We O

Assessment O
and O
plan: O
Mr. O
Christian O
Mullen O
is O
a O
delightful O
69-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease, O
hypertension, O
hyperlipidemia, O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
with O
prior O
bilateral O
aortoiliac O
revascularization O
here O
for O
a O
vascular O
followup O
with O
symptoms O
of O
bilateral O
hip, O
buttock, O
thigh, O
and O
claudication. O
Mr. O
Mullen's O
symptoms O
at O
present O
are O
suggestive O
of O
vascular O
claudication O
and O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
they O
are O
exertionally O
related. O
Interestingly, O
he O
has O
had O
these O
symptoms O
dating O
back O
to O
immediately O
following O
his O
revascularization O
procedures O
in O
2088 O
and O
2089. O
On O
examination O
today, O
his O
femoral O
pulses O
are O
certainly O
not O
robust O
and O
may O
suggest O
the O
presence O
of O
restenosis. O
We O
discussed O
with O
Mr. O
Mullen O
the O
potential O
of O
going O
forward O
with O
lower O
extremity O
noninvasive O
studies; O
however, O
these O
revealed O
supra-normal O
ABIs O
in O
the O
past O
secondary O
to O
his O
diabetes. O
Likewise, O
we O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
of O
moving O
forward O
with O
a O
non-invasive O
imaging O
study O
i.e. O
CT O
angiogram; O
however, O
this O
would O
not O
provide O
the O
option O
of O
therapeutic O
intervention O
if O
indeed O
narrowings O
were O
noted. O
Accordingly, O
Mr. O
Mullen O
is O
in O
favor O
of O
proceeding O
forward O
with O
diagnostic O
peripheral O
angiography O
plus/minus O
therapeutic O
intervention O
if O
restenosis O
of O
his O
aortoiliac O
segments O
are O
noted. O
It O
is O
indeed O
possible O
that O
there O
is O
a O
contributing O
factor O
of O
spinal O
stenosis O
in O
that O
Mr. O
Mullen's O
symptoms O
are O
relieved O
more O
quickly O
in O
the O
sitting O
position. O
Likewise, O
he O
has O
noted O
improvement O
upon O
leaning O
forward O
and O
against O
a O
tree. O
We O
understand O
that O
Mr. O
Mullen O
is O
being O
considered O
for O
an O
upcoming O
chemical O
stress O
test O
to O
assess O
the O
patency O
for O
any O
silent O
coronary O
ischemia. O
He O
is O
quite O
reticent O
to O
go O
forward O
with O
the O
chemical O
stress O
test O
though O
we O
did O
broach O
the O
subject O
of O
performing O
coronary O
catheterization O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
peripheral O
angiogram O
given O
that O
we O
are O
actually O
going O
to O
be O
in O
there. O
He O
has O
actually O
requested O
this O
as O
opposed O
to O
going O
forward O
with O
the O
chemical O
stress O
test. O
With O
your O
permission, O
we O
will O
perform O
both O
coronary O
catheterization O
to O
assess O
the O
patency O
of O
his O
grafts O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
peripheral O
angiogram O
plus/minus O
therapeutic O
intervention O
of O
his O
lower O
extremities. O
Paramount O
to O
his O
ongoing O
cardiovascular O
fitness, O
we O
certainly O
recommend O
blood O
pressure O
of O
130/80 O
or O
below O
and O
LDL O
cholesterol O
70 O
or O
below O
and O
ongoing O
exercise O
and O
weight O
loss. O
We O
will O
plan O
to O
schedule O
his O
procedure O
in O
the O
upcoming O
weeks O
and O
he O
is O
to O
notify O
us O
if O
symptoms O
are O
progressed O
in O
the O
interim O
time. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Cooper: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient, O
Christian O
Mullen O
today O
in O
the O
office O
in O
followup O
for O
his O
peripheral O
artery O
disease, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
coronary CAD
disease. CAD
I O
permanently O
follow O
him O
for O
PAD, O
as O
I O
know O
he O
follows O
with O
Dr. O
Fernandes O
for O
his O
coronary O
disease. O
Regarding O
his O
peripheral O
disease, O
he O
is O
status O
post O
left O
common O
femoral O
endarterectomy, O
performed O
at O
my O
request O
by O
Dr. O
Fredrick O
Xa O
couple O
of O
years O

This O
alleviated O
some O
of O
his O
left O
leg O
claudication, O
though O
he O
still O
has O
some O
residual O
symptoms O
in O
that O
left O
calf. O
The O
right O
calf O
is O
what O
bothers O
him O
more, O
with O
symptoms O
that O
are O
earlier O
in O
onset. O
They O
occurred O
about O
100 O
yards O
of O
walking O
on O
the O
flat. O
While O
Chris O
is O
affected O
by O
this, O
it O
does O
not O
preclude O
him O
from O
doing O
his O
usual O
activities O
of O
daily O
living. O
He O
also O
continues O
to O
travel O
(on O
his O
way O
to O
Bogalusa O
with O
Brad O
Fair, O
his O
partner, O
next O
week), O
and O
also O
continues O
to O
work O
actively. O
The O
biggest O
problem O
with O
his O
claudication O
is O
that O
it O
prevents O
him O
from O
being O
physically O
active O
enough O
to O
lose O
enough O
weight. O
As O
he O
says, O
he O
put O
on O
about O
80 O
pounds O
after O
his O
coronary CAD
bypass CAD
graft CAD
in CAD
2082, CAD
and O
he O
has O
had O
trouble O
losing O
the O
weight. O
He O
is O
considering O
weight O
reduction O
surgery, O
but O
has O
not O
made O
a O
decision O
about O
this O
yet. O
He O
is O
struggling O
with O
the O
decision. O
I O
would O
support O
him O
either O
way O
in O
this O
regard, O
encouraging O
him O
to O
lose O
weight O
however O
he O
can O
do O
so. O
In O
terms O
of O
his O
lower O
extremities, O
his O
exam O
demonstrates O
diminished O
pulses O
(absent O
to O
palpation) O
in O
both O
ankles, O
but O
they O
are O
audible O
by O
Doppler. O
Both O
feet O
are O
well O
perfused, O
with O
good O
capillary O
refill. O
He O
has O
no O
ulcers O
or O
gangrene. O
From O
a O
cardiac O
standpoint, O
Chris O
is O
doing O
well. O
He O
denies O
significant O
dyspnea O
or O
chest O
discomfort, O
although O
he O
is O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
walking O
because O
of O
his O
legs. O
It O
has O
been O
11 O
years O
since O
his O
bypass CAD
operation, CAD
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
do O
a O
stress O
test O
on O
him O
to O
make O
certain O
that O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
silent O
ischemia. O
While O
this O
might O
be O
controversial, O
as O
to O
whether O
to O
do O
a O
stress O
test O
or O
not, O
my O
own O
gut O
feeling O
is O
that O
it O
is O
probably O
the O
right O
time O
in O
this O
patient O
with O
significant O
risk O
factors O
and O
limitations O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
his O
lower O
extremity O
disease. O
He O
requests O
specifically O
we O
do O
this O
study O
here, O
so O
I O
will O
take O
the O
liberty O
of O
ordering O
an O
adenosine O
MIBI, O
and O
certainly O
will O
forward O
you O
the O
results. O
Otherwise, O
Chris O
is O
doing O
great. O
We O
will O
continue O
to O
work O
on O
risk O
factor O
modification O
and O
I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
six O
months. O
We O
will O
also O
order O
an O
exercise O
ABI O
and O
duplex O
of O
his O
lower O
extremities O
to O
assess O
where O
we O
stand O
at O
the O
present O
time. O
If O
his O
symptoms O
progress O
to O
the O
point O
where O
they O
are O
more O
disabling, O
then O
we O
would O
consider O
further O
evaluation. O
Otherwise, O
as O
long O
as O
his O
symptoms O
remain O
stable O
and O
his O
lifestyle O
is O
not O
terribly O
limited, O
we O
will O
continue O
the O
same. O
Other O
Data: O
I O
saw O
him O
today O
with O
Vernon O
Galvan, O
one O
of O
my O
cardiovascular O
fellows, O
who O
have O
written O
a O
detailed O
note. O
We O
will O
send O
this O
along O
to O
you O
as O
well. O
Thanks O
again. O

As O
you O
know, O
he O
previously O

to O
the O

He O
is O
status O
post O
hospitalization O
and O
some O
debridement O
and O
appears O
to O
have O
had O
little O
overall O
improvement O
in O
clinical O
status. O
I O
will O
proceed O
with O
an O
aggressive O
outpatient O
treatment O
plan O
however O
I O
suspect O
that O
he O
will O
need O
inpatient O
admission O
once O
again O
if O
significant O
improvement O
is O
not O
rapidly O
obtained. O
A O
referral O
has O
been O
made O

for O
this O

Visiting O

has O
been O
arranged O
for O
his O
home O
for O
wound O
care O
in O
the O
interim. O
He O
is O
advised O
to O
avoid O
all O
weight-bearing O
and O
to O
keep O
his O
foot O
dressed O
at O
all O
times. O
I O
have O
explained O
to O
the O
patient O
that O
he O
is O
at O
risk O
of O
amputation O
of O
at O
least O
his O
right O
great O
toe O
should O
his O
healing O
not O
improve. O
With O
regards O
to O
his O
other O
medical O
issues, O
he O
continues O
on O
dialysis. O
I O
have O
asked O
for O
a O
hemoglobin O
A1c O
and O
fasting O
cholesterol O
to O
be O
drawn O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O

tomorrow. O
I'll O
see O
the O

on O

His O

Assessment/Plan O
In O
summary,62 O
y/o O
male O
with O
multiple O
medical O
issues O
as O
outlined O
in O
this O
and O
many O
other O
notes. O
Presenting O
with O
necrotic O
foot O
infection, O
polymicrobial. O
S/P O
Rt O
TMA. O
Mildly O
delerious O
and O
certainly O
off O
from O
a O
baseline O
that O
was O
tenuous O
to O
start. O
By O
issue: O
1) O
CAD: O
The O
patient O
does O
have O
CAD, O
MR O
and O
cardiomyopathy O
that O
are O
really O
not O
amenable O
to O
intervention, O
given O
patient O
noncompliance. O
The O
best O
goal O
at O
present O
is O
going O
to O
be O
continued O
medical O
management. O
If O
BP O
allows, O
could O
increase O
toprol O
XL, O
although O
I O
suspect O
that O
this O
will O
not O
be O
an O
option. O
In O
addition, O
would O
aim O
to O
keep O
even O
at O
dialysis. O
Certainly, O
cycle O
CKs O
and O
troponin O
and O
follow O
sx. O
I O
will O
defer O
to O
Dr. O
Shah, O
but O
I O
don't O
see O
clear O
benefit O
for O
cardiac O
cath, O
especially O
as O
we O
are O
not O
going O
to O
proceed O
to O
valve O
repair O
at O
this O
juncture. O
If O
he O
were O
to O
become O
more O
compliant, O
this O
might O
be O
another O
consideration O
and O
as O
he O
is O
now O
a O
CT O
resident, O
perhaps O
this O
will O
be O
a O
future O
consideration. O
2) O
Delirium: O
He O
does O
have O
a O
very O
tenuous O
baseline O
and O
has O
significant O
vascular O
dementia O
to O
start. O
He O
is O
off O
of O
this O
baseline, O
likely O
reflecting O
sundowning, O
medications O
and O
underlying O
metabolic O
processes. O
Please O
d/c O
medications O
that O
might O
be O
contributing O
to O
sx. O
Fluoxetine O
can O
be O
held O
for O
now O
as O
it O
was O
only O
started O
3 O
weeks O
prior. O
Might O
hold O
ranitidine O
as O
well. O
Haldol O
is O
d/cd O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
his O
prolonged O
QTc. O
Currently O
on O
olanzapine. O
Would O
continue O
to O
follow O
QTc O
closely O
and O
would O
d/c O
this O
med O
as O
well O
is O
still O
prolonged. O
Please O
send O
urine O
culture O
and O
surveillance O
blood O
cultures. O
3) O
Infection: O
Appreciate O
excellent O
surgical O
management O
of O
patient's O
wound. O
Levofloxacin O
has O
been O
d/cd O
2nd O
to O
concerns O
for O
altered O
mental O
status. O
All O
bacteria O
are O
sensitive O
to O
aztreonam O
so O
perhaps O
this O
would O
be O
a O
reasonable O
alternative. O
Would O
seek O
ID O
input O
to O
the O
end. O
Wound O
care O
per O
vascular O
with O
plans O
for O
D/C O
when O
stable O
and O
return O
for O
closure O
in O
the O
future. O
4) O
ESRD: O
Patient O
HAD O
dialysis O
today O
. O
Recs O
per O
nephrology O
3) O
DM: O
HgA1c O
was O
at O
target. O
Please O
cover O
as O
needed O
with O
RISS O
for O
now. O
5) O
Competency: O
certainly O
not O
able O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
at O
this O
time. O
Please O
confirm O
that O
his O
daughter O
is O
his O
HCP. O
Would O
try O
to O
use O
a O
Chadian O
interpreter O
and O
not O

if O
at O
all O
possible. O

Assessment O
and O
plan: O
This O
is O
a O
59-year-old O
man O
with O
metabolic O
syndrome, O
diabetes O
type O
2, O
hyperlipidemia, O
hypertension, O
obesity, O
and O
mild O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
that O
has O
been O
medically O
managed. O
He O
is O
doing O
well. O
He O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
atrial O
flutter O
for O
two O
days O
in O
2069 O
but O
has O
not O
had O
any O
repeat O
episodes. O
He O
is O
currently O
not O
anticoagulated. O
Given O
new O
recommendations, O
his O
target O
LDL O
should O
be O
less O
than O
70. O
He O
is O
due O
for O
a O
fasting O
lipid O
profile O
in O
one O
week. O
If O
his O
LDL O
is O
not O
below O
70, O
then O
he O
should O
either O
be O
switched O
to O
Lipitor O
80 O
mg O
day O
or O
Zetia O
should O
be O
added O
to O
his O
present O
regimen. O
He O
is O
slightly O
hypertensive O
today O
with O
a O
blood HYPERTENSION
pressure HYPERTENSION
of HYPERTENSION
140/75. HYPERTENSION
The O
patient O
will O
check O
his O
blood O
pressure O
at O
home O
since O
he O
is O
somewhat O
anxious O
male. O
In O
the O
office O
today, O
if O
his O
blood O
pressure O
remains O
elevated, O
then O
I O
will O
increase O
his O
lisinopril O
to O
30 O
mg O
a O
day. O
Otherwise, O
he O
is O
doing O
very O
well O
without O
any O
cardiac O
symptoms. O

INITIAL O
VISIT O
This O
is O
a O
69-year-old O
white O
female O
coming O

The O
patient O
has O
a O

of O
type DIABETES
II DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES

and O
pituitary O
adenoma O
and O
recently O
was O
hospitalized O
at O
American O
Legion O
Hospital O
with O
general O
malaise O
syndrome O
and O
back/chest O
pain. O
Initially O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
at O
Neligh O
Clinic O
and O
cardiac O
ischemia O
was O
ruled O
out. O
She O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
blood HYPERTENSION
pressure HYPERTENSION
of HYPERTENSION

systolic HYPERTENSION
at O
Neligh O
Clinic O
associated O
with O
persistent O
headaches. O
She O
was O
transferred O
to O
American O
Legion O
Hospital O
after O
being O
found O
collapsed O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
hospital O
bathroom. O
She O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
at O
Neligh O
Clinic O
and O
treated O
for O
tonic-clonic O
convulsions O
with O
diazepam O
and O
lorazepam. O
She O
also O
suffered O
a O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
in O
hospital, O
treated O
with O
Cipro. O
She O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
American O
Legion O
Hospital O
on O
October O
02, O
2089, O
at O
which O
time O
she O
was O
awake O
but O
unable O
to O
give O
a O
history. O
On O
admission O
to O
American O
Legion O
Hospital O
she O
had O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
127/70, O
pulse O
was O
80, O
and O
temperature O
was O
99.3. O
She O
had O
a O
myxedematous O
face O
and O
was O
obese. OBESE
She O
was O
cardiovascularly O
stable. O
Neurologically, O
she O
was O
able O
to O
move O
all O
four O
extremities O
with O
good O
strength O
and O
symmetrical O
reflexes. O
Cranial O
nerves O
intact. O
Initially, O
the O
impression O
was O
that O
patient O
suffered O
seizure O
secondary O
to O
elevated O
blood O
pressure. O
Most O
likely, O
she O
suffered O
hypertensive O
encephalopathy. O
Patient O
underwent O
neurologic O
evaluation O
including O
MRA O
of O
the O
brain, O
lumbar O
puncture, O
both O
of O
which O
were O
negative. O
Electroencephalogram O
was O
performed O
and O
showed O
no O
epileptiform O
foci O
and O
diffuse O
temporal O
slowing O
bilaterally. O
The O
patient's O
alertness O
and O
responsiveness O
increased O
gradually O
during O
the O
hospital O
stay. O
She O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
chest O
pain O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
some O
ST O
flattening O
in O
the O
lateral O
leads. O
Acute O
cardiac O
event O
was O
ruled O
out. O
The O
patient O
underwent O
a O
course O
of O
physical O
therapy O
and O
then, O
finally, O
was O
transferred O
to O
a O
rehabilitation O
facility. O
A O
specific O
cause O
of O
the O
patient's O
seizure O
was O
not O
found O
although O
it O
was O
assumed O
that O
this O
might O
have O
been O
provoked O
by O
the O
hypertensive O
encephalopathy O
associated O
with O
use O
of O
ciprofloxacin O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
the O
UTI O
which O
could O
have O
lowered O
her O
threshold O
for O

activity. O
Upon O
discharge, O
the O
patient O
was O
in O

Patient O
confused O
and O
unable O
to O
give O

at O
time O
of O
admission. O
As O
per O
son O
and O
daughter, O
they O
have O
noticed O
increasing O
confusion O
and O
inappropriate O
behavior O
over O
the O
past O
3 O
days. O
They O
report O
that O
she O
has O
woken O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
c/o O
feeling O
weak O
and O
confused. O
The O
first O
two O
nights, O
her O
son O
treated O
her O
initially O
with O
increasing O
lactulose O
administration O
when O
she O
would O
wake O
up O
at O
night O
(although O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
she O
had O
any O
increase O
in O
her O
stool) O
and O
he O
reports O
that O
she O
would O
behave O
better O
during O
the O
day. O
On O
the O
night O
prior O
to O
administration, O
the O
patient O
urinated O
in O
her O
bed O
at O
night O
and O
called O
her O
daughter O
on O
the O
phone O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night. O
She O
also O
forgot O
the O
names O
of O
her O
grandchildren. O
The O
son O
became O
worried O
about O
her O
behavior, O
contacted O
her O
PCP, O
and O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
ALH O

The O
family O
reports O
that O
she O
experienced O
similar O

prior O

that O
were O
a O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
This O
pleasant O
62-year-old O
African O
American O
gentleman O
returns O
to O
my O
clinic O
today O
for O
follow-up O
of O

and O
hypertension. HYPERTENSION
1. O
He O
brings O
in O
his O
blood O
sugar O
values O
with O
him O
today. O
These O
are O
improved O
since O
his O
last O
visit, O
and O
somewhat O
more O
believable O
ranging O
from O
128 O
to O
195, O
predominantly O
higher O
in O
the O
evenings O
more O
than O
the O
mornings O
ranging O
from O
150 O
to O
190. O
He O
is O
currently O
on O
a O
somewhat O
odd O

a O
large O
24 O
units O
of O
insulin O
at O

He O
has O
not O
had O
any O
further O
hypoglycemic O
attacks, O
is O
having O
no O
nocturnal O
awakening, O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
sticking O
more O
to O
the O
diet. O
He O
has O
however O
gained O
some O
weight, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
disconcerting. O
He O
does O
attend O
a O
podiatrist O
and O
is O
doing O
well O
from O
that O
perspective. O
He O
is O
to O
return O
to O
the O
ophthalmologist O
for O
further O
diabetic O
screening O
later O
on O
in O
the O
year. O
He O
missed O
his O
last O

in O
further O
follow-up O
with O

at O
this O
time. O

is O
on O
atorvastatin MEDICATION
20 O
mg O

25 O
mg, O
and O
aspirin. MEDICATION
Further O
question O
regarding O
his O
stroke O
back O
in O
2061 O
shows O
that O
this O
presents O
with O
confusional O
episode O
with O
unsteadiness, O
resolving O
after O
approximately O
36 O
hours, O
and O
he O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a O
hole O
in O
his O
heart O
at O
that O
time. O
He O
was O
eventually O
stopped O
off O
Coumadin O
in O
2063, O
but O
had O
a O
recurrent O
episode O
at O
that O
time O
and O
he O
was O
put O
on O
Coumadin O
for O
life O
at O
that O
point. O
He O
had O
an O
aborted CAD
myocardial CAD
infarction CAD
in CAD
2067. CAD
He O
has O
had O
no O
chest O
pain O
in O
the O
interim, O
has O
good O
exercise O
tolerance O
with O
walking, O
although, O
he O
can O
only O
run O
about O
50 O
yards O
before O
getting O
very O
short O
of O
breath. O
He O
has O
no O
orthopnea O
or O
PND. O
He O
has O
no O
chest O
pain O
or O
use O
of O
sublingual O
nitro. O
3. O
Health O
maintenance. O
We O
discussed O
screening O
colonoscopy O
versus O
flexible O
sigmoidoscopy O
and O
the O
relative O
benefit O
of O
each O
of O
those. O
He O
has O
agreed O
to O
proceed O
with O
colonoscopy, O
and O
I O
have O
instructed O
him O
stop O
his O

and O
to O
have O
an O

However, O
he O
has O
not O
had O
any O

without O
any O
evidence O
of O
congestive O
heart O

on O

He O
continues O
to O
exercise O
on O
a O
regular O
basis. O
Given O
his O
slightly O

his O

be O
increased O
to O
25 O
mg O
PO O

he O
will O
come O
to O
the O
emergency O

immediately. O
He O
is O
encouraged O
to O
use O

Since O
the O

he O
developed O
a O

and O
his O
Plavix MEDICATION
was MEDICATION

Since O
this O

the O
only O

it O
was O
presumed O
that O
Plavix O
was O
the O

of O
the O
new O

He O
also O
changed O

approximately O

his O

and O
now, O
is O
in O
the O

He O
denies O
any O

PND, O
orthopnea, O
or O
shortness O

He O
has O
had O
no O

his O

in O
the O

He O
has O
had O
weight O

and O
slightly O
diminished O

and O
this O
may O
account O
for O
his O

He O
is O
here O
for O
a O

Of O
note, O
his O

and O
no O

EKG: O
NSR O

LAE, O
NSTTWA O
Assessment: O
I O
agree O
he O
clearly O
needs O
a O
coronary O
angiogram O
as O
well O
as O
a O
left O
ventricular O
angiogram O
to O
assess O
MR. O
He O
should O
also O
have O
a O
left O
right O
heart O
catheter O
because O
of O
the O
aortic O
ejection O
murmur. O
In O
the O
meantime O
I O
will O
ask O
into O
double O
his O
isosorbide O
to O
40 O
mg O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
again O
at O
3 O
p.m. O
to O
give O
him O
better O
protection O
throughout O
the O
day. O
I O
will O
ask O
him O
to O
increase O
his O
aspirin O
to O
325 O
mg O
a O
day. O
I O
will O
also O
add O
fish O
oil O
1000 O
mg O
a O
day O
which O
is O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
sudden O
death. O
Finally O
we O
will O
double O
his O
Zocor O
to O
40 O
mg O
to O
try O
to O
reach O
the O
new O
goal O
of O
an O
LDL O
of O
less O
than O
70. O
I O
explained O
the O
rationale O
for O
proceeding O
on O
with O
the O
catheterization O
and O
the O
probability O
that O
we O
will O
find O
multivessel O
disease O
that O
will O
not O
be O
suitable O
for O
PCI O
but O
rather O
for O
continued O
medicine O
or O
possible O
surgery. O
Of O
course O
the O
catheterization O
will O
determine O
that. O
He O
should O
not O
consider O
any O
total O
knee O
operation O
until O
the O
cardiac O
status O
is O
clarified. O

IDDM, DIABETES
large O

in O
2066, O
and O
now O
with O
myelodysplastic O
syndrome. O
He O
was O
treated O
with O
CHOP O
in O
2066 O
followed O
by O
radiotherapy, O
completed O
in O
Nov O
2066. O
He O
was O
free O
of O
disease O
since O
then O
until O
May O
2073. O
He O
sought O
primary O
care O
for O
a O
URI O
and O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
anemic O
(HCT O
31). O
His O
counts O
were O
followed O
and O
when O
his O
HCT O
dropped O
as O
low O
as O
22 O
a O
Bone O
Marrow O
was O
done O
and O
showed O
myelodysplastic O
syndrome. O
He O
was O
considered O
for O
a O
allogenic O
stem-cell O
transplant. O
His O
major O
complaint O
is O
a O
dry O
cough O
that O
he O
has O
had O
since O
May O
2073. O
It O
is O
provoked O
by O
eating, O
drinking O
and O
lying O
down. O
And O
only O
occasionally O
does O
he O
produce O
any O
sputum. O
He O
has O
been O
on O
numerous O
antibiotics O
in O
the O
past O
four O
months O
for O
the O
cough O
and O
he O
also O
developed O
a O
periorbital O
cellulitis O
for O
which O
he O
was O
hospitalized O
at O
Educare-Fargo O
for O
which O
he O
received O
a O
3 O
week O
course O
of O
Ceftriaxone, O
Nafcillin O
and O
flagyl O
(finished O
at O
the O
end O
of O
July). O
In O
retrospect, O
he O
recognizes O
sinus O
pressure/congestion O
associated O
with O
periorbital O
cellulitis. O
In O
August O
2073 O
he O
had O
a O
questionable O
LLL O
PNA O
and O
was O
treated O
with O
cipro. O
On O
pre-transplant O
work-up, O
CXR O
revealed O
increase O
conspicuity O
of O
ill-defined O
LL O
zone O
opacity. O
CT O
chest O
reviewed O
today O
revealed O
mutlifocal O
pneumonia O
with O
associated O
radiation-related O
changes. O
Throughout O
this O
time O
period O
he O
has O
only O
had O
a O
few O
days O
of O
fever O
for O
which O
he O
was O
at O
KCGH O
and O
given O
abx O
and O
defervesced. O
He O
recalls O
nightsweats O
as O
the O
fevers O
broke. O
He O
does O
admit O
to O
maybe O
a O
10 O
lb O
weight O

in O
the O

and O
now O
with O
myelodysplastic O
syndrome O
who O
presents O
with O
fourth O
months O
of O
cough O
of O
unclear O
etiology. O
The O
differential O
diagnosis O
is O
broad O
and O
includes O
both O
infectious O
and O
non-infectious O
diagnoses. O
Our O
leading O
diagnosis O
is O
either O
radiation O
fibrosis O
or O
a O
primary O
interstitial O
lung O
disease, O
such O
as O
COP. O
However, O
we O
also O
think O
that O
several O
infectious O
etiologies O
should O
be O
considered. O
Endemic O
mycoses O
(histo, O
blasto O
and O
crypto), O
cryptococcal O
pneumonia, O
nocardiasis, O
aspergillus, O
mucormycosis O
and O
MAC O
are O
some O
diseases O
to O
consider O
in O
this O
patient. O
While O
the O
clinical O
picture O
of O
granulomas O
on O
chest O
CT O
and O
cough O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
mycobacterial O
disease, O
the O
patient O
is O
very O
low O
risk O
for O
this O
infection O
and O
his O
lack O
of O
fevers, O
progressive O
weight O
loss O
and O
systemic O
illness O
argues O
against O
this O
diagnosis. O
I O
(AYX) O
have O
interviewed O
and O
examined O
Mr. O
Ware, O
and O
confirmed O
all O
of O
the O
findings O
documented O
in O
this O
note. O
My O
highest O
suspicion O
is O
for O
an O
inflammatory O
process, O
such O
as O
radiation O
pneumonitis O
or O
BOOP/COP. O
An O
occult O
infection O
is O
quite O
possible, O
such O
as O
pulmonary O
MAC O
or O
a O
mold O
(the O
lesion O
in O
his O
left O
lower O
lobe O
is O
especially O
suspicious). O
Clinically O
he O
is O
unchanged O
over O
many O
months, O
so O
empiric O
antibiotics O
would O
not O
be O
indicated. O
We O
recommend O
the O
following O
work-up: O
-Expectorated O
sputum O
for O
gram O
stain O
and O
culture O
-Induced O
sputum O
for O
-PCP O
-Modified O
AFB O
smear O
(looking O
for O
Nocardia) O
-Fungal O
stain O
and O
culture O
-Urine O
histo O
antigen O
-Serum O
cryptococcal O
antigen O
-Weekly O
monitoring O
of O
galactomannan O
and O
D-glucan O
-Nasopharyngeal O

panel O
(RSV, O
Adenovirus, O
Influenza O

and O
B, O

and O

and O

culture O
If O
the O
above O
work-up O
is O
unrevealing, O
please O
consult O
pulmonology O
for O
a O
bronchoscopy O
-- O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later. O

scheduled O

significant O
nausea, O
somewhat O
controlled O
with O
zofran. O
Diarrhea O
can O
be O
a O
component O
posaconazole O
side O
effect, O
or O
due O
to O
dumping O
syndrome. O
Plan: O
1) O
continue O
posaconazole O
2) O
need O
to O
have O

evaluate O

Will O

Mr. O
Ethridge O
seen O
and O
examined O
with O
Dr. O
Roberts. O
He O
is O
very O
slowly O
improving O
in O
terms O
of O
strength, O
no O
doubt O
in O
part O
due O
to O
nocturnal O
TPN. O
Hard O
to O
tease O
out O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
nausea, O
although O
anatomic O
reasons O
are O
as O
likely O
as O
medication O
side O
effects. O
On O
balance, O
if O
his O
labs O
are O
ok, O
I'd O
favor O
continuing O
the O
posaconazole O
given O
most O
recent O
OR O
findings. O
ECG O

Abdomen O
is O
bening. O

who O
underwent O
an O
arteriovenous O
graft O
placement O
ten O
days O
prior O

The O
patient O
was O
doing O
well O
until O
a O
few O
days O

when O
he O
noticed O
a O
swelling O
in O
his O
new O
graft O
and O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
degree O
of O
its O

Then O
on O
the O
morning O

when O
he O
noticed O
his O
graft O
was O
without O
a O

The O
patient O
then O
presented O

the O

prescribed O
as O
a O

Eva O

had O
persistently O

I O
have O
asked O
her O

stop O

she O
blames O
for O

and O
to O
begin O
taking O

I O
will O
see O

to O
make O
sure O
that O
she O
is O
not O
having O
any O
difficulties O

and O
also O
to O
check O
her O

once O
again. O

Right O
leg O
pain: O
This O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
chronic O
and O
may O
well O
be O
related O
to O
her O
work, O
which O
requires O
her O
to O
scuttle O
throughout O
the O
hospital O
at O
fairly O
high O
speed O
(She O
is O
a O
Pulping O
Control O
Operator.) O
I O
have O
asked O
her O
to O
continue O
taking O
Tylenol O
and O
we O
will O
re-evaluate O
her O
need O
for O
more O
powerful O
agents, O
such O
as O

if O
the O

arises. O

Unfortunately, SMOKER
Eva O

In O
order O
to O
prevent O
this O

recurring O
a O
third O

I O
have O
called O
and O
made O
an O
appointment O
for O
her O
with O
Dr. O
Eileen O

She O
is O
to O
see O
him O
on O
the O
29th O

at O

I O
have O

left O
a O

on O

mentioning O

him. O
Hopefully, O
he O
can O
help O

the O

Dear O
Dr. O
Trujillo: O
Thank O
you O
for O
referring O
Mrs. O
Shirley O
Trent, O
a O
68-year-old O
lady O
with O
peripheral O
artery O
disease, O
on O
whom O
you O
plan O
to O
do O
revascularization O
of O
the O
right O
leg. O
Her O
history O
is O
well O
known O
to O
you O
but O
I O
will O
repeat O
it O
for O
our O
records. O
She O
has O
a O
long SMOKER
history SMOKER

a SMOKER
3-packet-per-day SMOKER
history SMOKER

15 SMOKER
years SMOKER
ago. SMOKER
She O
has O
developed O
claudication, O
particularly O
in O
the O
right O
leg, O
over O
the O
last O
year O
since O
her O
husband O
died, O
which O
has O
all O
the O
typical O
symptoms O
and O
is O
relieved O
by O
rest. O
This O
seems O
predominantly O
in O
the O
right O
calf O
but O
is O
also O
in O
the O
right O
thigh O
as O
well. O
She O
had O
segmental O
leg O
pressures O
done O
which O
shows O
some O
mild O
diminution O
in O
the O
left O
leg O
but O
an O
ankle-brachial O
index O
of O
0.65 O
in O
the O
right O
leg. O
An O
MR O
angiogram O
showed O
stenosis, O
although O
I O
do O
not O
have O
the O
full O
report O
on O
this O
as O
yet. O
She O
has O
intercurrent O
problems O
with O
insulin-dependent DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES
mellitus, DIABETES
which O
she O
has O
had O
for O
10 O
years. O
Her O
other O
cardiac O
risk O
factors O
apart O
from O
cigarette O
smoking O
include O
a O
family O
history O
of O
myocardial O
infarction O
in O
her O
father, O
and O
it O
is O
uncertain O
what O
her O
cholesterol O
level O
is. O
She O
has O
no O
history O
of O
hypertension, O
although O
I O
am O
uncertain O
whether O
this O
has O
been O
checked O
in O
the O
past. O
She O
has O
a O
past O
history O
of O
partial O
gastrectomy O
in O
2059 O
for O
a O
bleeding O
peptic O
ulcer O
and O
this O
has O
led O
to O
some O
difficulty O
in O
swallowing O
tablets O
and O
keeping O
them O
down. O
She O
also O
has O
a O
past O
history O
of O
a O
right O
middle O
lobectomy O
in O
2079 O
for O
adenocarcinoma O
that O
had O
clear O
margins O
and O
did O
not O
require O
further O
adjunctive O
therapy. O
She O
also O
had O
a O
cholecystectomy O
in O
2079, O
which O
was O
uneventful. O
Systems O
review O
reveal O
no O
chest O
discomfort, O

the O
arms, O
face, O
or O
legs, O
seizures O
or O
visual O

and O
all O
other O
systems O
are O
negative. O
She O
lives O
alone, O
and O
her O
current O
medications O
include O
insulin O
only. O
She O
has O
no O
allergies. O
On O
physical O
examination, O
she O
is O
alert O
and O
orientated O
without O
any O
signs O
of O
jaundice, O
clubbing, O
or O
cyanosis. O
Her O
heart O

was O
85 O

with O
a O
blood HYPERTENSION
pressure HYPERTENSION
of HYPERTENSION
160/85 HYPERTENSION
in O
both O
arms. O
The O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
was O
not O
elevated, O
and O
her O
carotid O
upstrokes O
were O
reduced, O
but O
she O
had O
no O
bruits O
audible. O
Her O
apex O
beat O
was O
not O
palpable, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
normal O
first O
and O
second O
heart O
sound O
without O
added O
sounds, O
murmurs, O
or O
gallops. O
Her O
chest O
was O
clear O
to O
percussion O
and O
auscultation. O
She O
had O
no O
hepatosplenomegaly O
and O
no O
abdominal O
masses O
or O
pulsations. O
She O
had O
the O
scars O
from O
previous O
operations O
present. O
Her O
femoral O
pulses O
were O
absent O
on O
the O
right O
side O
and O
reduced O
on O
the O
left O
side O
without O
bruits. O
She O
had O
reduced O
but O
palpable O
dorsalis O
pedis O
and O
posterior O
tibial O
pulses O
on O
the O
left O
leg O
but O
no O
pedal O
pulses O
on O
the O
right O
leg. O
There O
were O
no O
trophic O
changes O
in O
her O
legs. O
She O
had O
reduced O
sensation O
to O
pinprick O
in O
both O
feet O
to O
the O
mid O
calf O
level O
in O
a O
stocking O
distribution. O
Her O
ECG O
showed O
sinus O
rhythm O
without O
abnormalities. O
Assessment: O
This O
lady O
obviously O
has O
severe O
claudication O
and O
requires O
revascularization, O
but O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
she O
has O
any O
myocardial O
ischemia. O
I O
therefore O
think O
a O
stress O
test O
is O
required. O
She O
also O
has O
difficulty O
in O
swallowing O
medications O
and O
this O
will O
prove O
a O
problem O
for O
the O
long-term O
management O
of O
her O
atherosclerosis, O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
further O
evaluate. O
Plan: O
I O
therefore O
organized O
a O
dobutamine O
stress O
test O
to O
assess O
for O
myocardial O
ischemia O
and O
cardiovascular O
risk. O
I O
have O
also O
asked O
her O
to O
start MEDICATION
on MEDICATION
a MEDICATION
small MEDICATION
dose MEDICATION
of MEDICATION
a MEDICATION
beta-blocker MEDICATION
for O
reducing O
her O
perioperative O
risk O
as O
well O
as O
treating O
her O
blood O
pressure, O
which O
is O
elevated. O
I O
have O
also O
asked O
her O
to O
have O
a O
fasting O
blood O
lipid O
test O
today O
so O
we O
can O
assess O
her O
cholesterol O
level, O
as O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
lipid-lowering O
therapy. O
I O
plan O
to O
evaluate O
all O
these O
in O
approximately O
a O
month O
or O
so O
after O
her O
operation O
so O
that O
we O
can O
manage O
her O
in O
the O
long O
term. O
I O
will O
let O
you O
know O
the O
results O
of O
her O
stress O
test O
when O
they O
become O
available. O
Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
take O
part O
in O
this O
lady's O
care. O
Yours O
sincerely, O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
Ms. O
Trent O
is O
69, O
a O
pleasant O
lady O
who O
is O
now O
a O
widow O
well O
known O
to O
me O
for O
her O
insulin-dependent DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES
and O
her O
poor O
compliance O
with O
treatment. O
In O
the O
past, O
she O
also O
has O
experienced O
upper O
GI O
bleeding O
due O
to O
a O
peptic O
ulcer O
and O
has O
undergone O
cholecystectomy O
as O
well O
as O
lobectomy O
for O
carcinoma O
of O
the O
lung. O
CURRENT O
MEDICATIONS: O
Humulin MEDICATION
N MEDICATION
25 O
units O
in O
the O
morning. O
She O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
using O
28 O
units O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
8 O
units O
in O
the O
evening O
depending O
on O
blood O
sugars. O
She O
also O
has O
been O
prescribed O
an O
ACE MEDICATION
inhibitor MEDICATION
and O
a O
beta MEDICATION
blocker, MEDICATION
which O
she O
has O
neglected O
to O
take. O
Her O
last O
visit O
to O
the O
practice O
was O
in O
September O
of O
last O
year. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
her O
last O
visit, O
I O
referred O
to O
vascular O
surgery O
because O
of O
claudication O
of O
the O
right O
leg. O
She O
underwent O
a O
femoral O
public O
TL O
bypass O
in O
December O
and O
did O
well O
postoperatively. O
She O
was O
discharged O
on O
simvastatin, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
Plavix, MEDICATION
as O
well O
as O
atenolol MEDICATION
and O
lisinopril. MEDICATION
She O
abandoned O
all O
tablets O
on O
her O
own O
and O
did O
not O
come O
for O
her O
followup O
appointment O
with O
us. O
Today, O
she O
tells O
me O
that O
claudication O
in O
the O
right O
leg O
has O
disappeared O
completely O
but O
during O
the O
past O
two O
months, O
she O
has O
begun O
noticing O
pain O
in O
the O
left O
leg O
after O
10-15 O
minutes O
of O
walking O
which O
forces O
her O
to O
stop. O
An O
arteriogram O
carried O
out O
in O
September O
of O
last O
year O
showed O
mild O
diffuse O
disease O
involving O
the O
left O
common O
iliac, O
external O
iliac, O
and O
common O
femoral O
arteries. O
She O
did O
not O
have O
symptoms O
on O
the O
left O
side O
at O
the O
time. O
The O
patient O
denies O
chest O
pain, O
palpitation, O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
orthopnea, O
and O
ankle O
edema. O
Prior O
to O
her O
bypass O
surgery O
on O
the O
right O
leg, O
she O
underwent O
a O
Persantine O
MIBI O
which O
showed O
only O
1 O
mm O
ST O
depressions O
and O
was O
considered O
not O
diagnostic. O
Ms. O
Trent O
has O
experienced O
some O
polyuria O
and O
mild O
polydipsia O
and O
has O
two O
times O
nocturia. O
She O
denies O
dysuria. O
The O
last O
hemoglobin DIABETES
A1c DIABETES
was DIABETES
8.4 DIABETES
in O
September O
of O
last O
year. O
At O
that O
time, O
her O
serum O
cholesterol O
was O
238, O
HDL O
was O
59, O
and O
triglycerides O
were O
263. O

insulin-dependent O
diabetes O
and O
hyperlipidemia. HYPERLIPIDEMIA
She O
has O
not O
been O
compliant O
with O
her O
medications. O
She O
has O
suffered O
from O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O
and O
claudication O
in O
the O
past O
underwent O
a O

proteinuria. O
Today, O
I O
have O
repeated O
her O
hemoglobin O
A1c, O
comprehensive O
panel, O

and O
urine O
analysis. O
I O
have O
spent O
20 O
minutes O
speaking O
to O
her O
and O
to O
her O
daughter O
concerning O
the O
importance O
of O
compliance O
and O
explaining O
the O
rationale O
for O
the O
lisinopril. O
I O
have O
prescribed O
Lipitor MEDICATION
10 O

I O
will O
see O
her O
again O
after O
the O
above O
test O
results O
to O
decide O
whether O
we O
need O
to O
adjust O
her O
medications. O
I O
have O
increased O
her O
insulin O
to O
28 O
units O
every O
morning. O
She O
will O
come O
to O
see O
the O

in O
three O
days' O
time O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
a O

An O

will O
be O
obtained O
and O
a O

will O
be O
arranged O
with O
vascular O

concerning O
the O

and O
vomiting. O
Her O
neurological O
exam O
was O
difficult O
with O
inconsistent O
findings. O
She O
appears O
to O
have O
decreased O
spontaneous O
movement O
of O
the O
RUE, O
but O
when O
passively O
moved O
into O
shoulder O
flexion O
she O
was O
able O
to O
hold O
the O
position O
against O
gravity O
for O
several O
seconds. O
Her O
RLE O
symptoms O
are O
likely O
confounded O
by O
her O
lumbar O
spine O
disease O
at O
L5/S1 O
as O
noted O
above. O
She O
is O
hyperglycemic DIABETES
(serum DIABETES
glucose DIABETES
313), DIABETES
has O
a O
mild O
leukocytosis, O
is O
iron O
deficient, O
and O
has O
new O
onset O
today O
of O
fairly O
severe O
nausea/vomiting O
and O
SOB O
of O
unclear O
etiology. O
She O
appears O
to O
have O
vasculopathic O
changes/lacunes O
in O
the O
brain O
seen O
as O
hypodensities O
on O
the O
CT O
today, O
all O
appearing O
old. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
any O
right O
facial O
weakness, O
no O
dysarthria, O
no O
aphasia, O
no O
flaccidity/spasticity, O
no O
gaze O
preference. O
While O
stroke O
can O
not O
be O
ruled O
out, O
her O
exam O
does O
not O
clearly O
suggest O
a O
typical O
stroke O
syndrome. O
Ddx O
includes O
seizure, O
infection O
or O
metabolic O
abnormality O
causing O
unmasking O
of O
stroke-like O
symptoms, O
migraine O
phenomena O
superimposed O
on O
current O
medical/metabolic O
abnormalities. O
RECOMMENDATIONS: O
1. O
MRI/MRA O
of O
the O
head O
and O
neck O
(stroke O
protocol), O
as O
well O
as O
MRI O
of O
C-spine O
given O
UE O
symptoms O
2. O
We O
currently O
recommend O
admission O
to O
medicine O
given O
multiple O
medical O
issues O
(severe O
HTN, HYPERTENSION
SOB O
as O
yet O
unexplained, O
N/V, O
hyperglycemia). O
3. O
BP O
control: O
Labetolol MEDICATION
to O
maintain O
BP O
less O
than O
200 O
systolic; O
avoid O
large/rapid O
shifts O
to O
maintain O
cerebral O
perfusion O
pressure. O
Would O
allow O
some O
degree O
of O
hypertension HYPERTENSION
(max O
200 O
SBP) O
until O
stroke O
protocol O
MRI/MRA O
obtained. O
4. O
Glycemic O
control-need O
to O
clarify O
home O
insulin O
regimen O
5. O
Resend O
cardiac O
markers O
in O
setting O
of O
tachycardia O
to O
150s O
6. O
F/u O
PE O
protocol O
CT O
(done O
in O

7. O
Patient O
will O
be O
followed O
by O
the O

Dear O
Dr. O
Pearson: O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mrs. O
Shirley O
Trent O
in O
follow O
up O
this O
morning. O
Mrs. O
Trent O
is O
a O
71 O
year-old O
right-handed O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
a O
left O
corona O
radiata O
stroke O
in O
December O
2094 O
complicated O
by O
a O
dense O
right O
hemiparesis. O
She O
presented O
today O
with O
her O
granddaughter, O
Ms. O
Carey O
Trent. O
Ms. O
Trent O
translated O
and O
provided O
supplemental O
interval O
history. O
Interval O
History O
Mrs. O
Trent O
moved O
to O
the O
Eddie O
Bauer O
Nursing O
home O
approximately O
one O
month O
ago. O
She O
has O
continued O
to O
have O
a O
dense O
paresis O
of O
the O
right O
arm O
and O
leg, O
which O
has O
confined O
her O
to O
a O
wheelchair. O
She O
has O
had O
spasticity, O
in O
particular O
of O
the O
right O
leg, O
that O
has O
been O
painful O
at O
times O
and O
has O
contributed O
to O
sleeping O
difficulties. O
Baclofen O
was O
initiated O
and O
titrated O
to O
20 O
mg O
TID, O
with O
some O
efficacy. O
According O
to O
Carey, O
another O
medication O
may O
have O
been O
used O
around O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
year. O
Gabapentin O
was O
initiated O
at O
a O
dose O
of O
100 O
mg O
HS O
on O
2/10/96. O
Mrs. O
Trent O
related O
that O
she O
has O
had O
a O
depressed O
mood O
in O
recent O
months. O
A O
son O
with O
whom O
she O
was O
close O
died O
in O
August O
of O
last O
year O
from O
complications O
following O
an O
admission O
to O
the O
hospital O
with O
asthma. O
This O
was O
extremely O
difficult O
for O
Mrs. O
Trent. O
She O
has O
felt O
'alone,' O
but O
has O
enjoyed O
visits O
to O
the O
nursing O
home O
from O
Carey O
and O
from O
Carey's O
aunt, O
one O
of O
Mrs. O
Trent's O
daughters. O
Her O
other O
children O
have O
not O
maintained O
close O
contact. O
Mrs. O
Trent O
had O
increased O
weakness O
and O
slurring O
of O
her O
speech O
in O
early O
February, O
which O
may O
have O
been O
related O
to O
a O
urinary O
tract O
infection O
or O
sedating O
medication O
used O
at O
that O
time. O
Aside O
from O
that O
episode, O
Mrs. O
Trent O
reported O
no O
episodes O
of O
weakness, O
numbness, O
clumsiness, O
visual O
changes, O
slurred O
speech, O

Impression O
Mrs. O
Shirley O
Trent O
is O
a O
71 O
year-old O
right-handed O
woman O
who O
had O
a O
stroke O
in O
the O
left O
corona O
radiata O
in O
December O
2094. O
Her O
stroke O
risk O
factors O
include O
history O
of O
diabetes O
mellitus, O
dyslipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
peripheral O
arterial O
disease, O
and O
left O
carotid O
stenosis O
with O
a O
calcified O
plaque. O
She O
has O
not O
had O
any O
clinical O
events O
suggestive O
of O
stroke O
in O
the O
interim O
between O
11/94 O
and O
now. O
Mrs. O
Trent's O
current O
neurological O
and O
psychiatric O
problems O
include O
spasticity O
of O
the O
right O
arm O
and O
leg O
and O
depression. O
Plan O
1. O
We O
will O
obtain O
repeat O
carotid O
studies O
to O
assess O
for O
interval O
progression O
of O
the O
left O
carotid O
stenosis. O
2. O
We O
recommend O
continued O
management O
of O
vascular O
risk O
factors, O
with O
(1) O
target O
BP O
120/80 O
or O
less, O
(2) O
target O
LDL O
&lt; O
100, O
(3) O
continued O
glycemic O
control. O
Continue O
clopidogrel MEDICATION
as O
an O
antiplatelet O
agent. O
3. O
Regarding O
the O
spasticity, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
utilize O
a O
higher O
evening O
dose O
of O
gabapentin O
and O
assess O
the O
efficacy. O
Other O
potential O
agents O
to O
consider O
for O
future O
use O
include O
cyclobenzaprine, O
tizanidine, O
and O
trihexyphenidyl. O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
follow O
and O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
discuss O
this O
management O
with O
you O
at O
any O
time. O
4. O
I O
agree O
with O
mirtazapine O
for O
antidepressant O
therapy O
given O
Mrs. O
Trent's O
poor O
appetite O
and O
impaired O
sleep. O
After O
her O
gabapentin O
has O
been O
appropriately O
titrated, O
one O
may O
consider O
increasing O
mirtazapine O
to O
45 O
mg O
HS. O
5. O
Mrs. O
Trent O
will O
be O
scheduled O
for O
follow O
up O
in O
approximately O
6 O
months. O
It O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
Mrs. O
Trent O
with O
you. O
Greater O
than O
50% O
of O
this O
60 O

the O

Dear O
Dr. O
Faust: O
Thank O
you O
for O
kindly O
referring O
your O
patient, O
Jacob O
Rodriquez, O
to O
the O
Internal O
Medicine O
for O
evaluation O
of O
pulmonary O
hypertension. HYPERTENSION
Although O
I'm O
sure O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
his O
history, O
I O
will O
review O
it O
now O
for O
our O
records. O
Dr. O
Rodriquez O
is O
a O
77-year-old O
retired O
Electrician O
at O
Wells O
Fargo O
who O
by O
his O
report O
has O
enjoyed O
excellent O
health O
until O
the O
past O
year. O
He O
denies O
any O
prior O
history O
of O
hypertension, O
coronary O
artery O
disease, O
chest O
pains, O
significant O
childhood O
illnesses O
or O
malignancy. O
He O
describes O
his O
usual O
baseline O
health O
as O
excellent. O
He O
is O
a O
religious O
walker, O
walking O
multiple O
times O
each O
week O
as O
well O
as O
a O
woodwind O
and O
singing O
enthusiast. O
Dr. O
Rodriquez O
states O
that O
in O
approximately O
April O
or O
Mayof O
the O
past O
year O
he O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
with O
hyperglycemia. O
This O
was O
treated O
with O
Metformin. MEDICATION
Subsequently O
Hydrochlorothiazide MEDICATION
and O
Zestril MEDICATION
were O
added O
apparently O
for O
hypertension O
(although O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
believe O
he O
has O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
hypertension). O
He O
subsequently O
developed O
diarrhea O
which O
he O
felt O
was O
related O
to O
Glucophage MEDICATION
which O
was O
subsequently O
reduced O
in O
dose. O
In O
June O
of O
the O
past O
year O
the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
anemic O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
related O
to O
sulfa O
in O
his O
Hydrochlorothiazide. O
At O
that O
time O
he O
also O
was O
found O
to O
have O
lower O
extremity O
edema O
which O
worsened O
with O
the O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
Hydrochlorothiazide. O
The O
patient O
states O
in O
September O
of O
2119 O
he O
traveled O
to O
trinidad O
and O
tobago. O
While O
in O
trinidad O
and O
tobago O
he O
had O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
his O
lower O
extremity O
edema O
to O
the O
point O
that O
he O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
ambulate. O
He O
denied O
any O
difficulty O
with O
chest O
pains O
or O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
He O
had O
no O
hemoptysis O
and O
no O
focal O
unilateral O
leg O
swelling O
despite O
the O
long O
period O
of O
immobility O
during O
the O
trip. O
He O
was O
seen O
by O
a O
Trinidad O
physician O
who O
prescribed O
an O
ethacrynic O
acid O
which O
reduced O
his O
lower O
extremity O
edema O
significantly. O
However, O
he O
subsequently O
developed O
diarrhea O
to O
this O
medication O
and O
it O
was O
stopped. O
Subsequently O
his O
lower O
extremity O
has O
once O
again O
worsened O
and O
has O
been O
treated O
with O
increasing O
doses O
of O
Lasix O
and O
with O
the O
recent O
addition O
of O
Zaroxolyn. MEDICATION
At O
the O
present O
time O
Dr. O
Rodriquez O
states O
that O
he O
has O
no O
overt O
shortness O
of O
breath. O
He O
still O

He O
does O
find O

in O
the O

several O

He O
believes O
this O
is O
entirely O
due O
to O

accumulation. O
He O
denies O
any O
difficulties O
with O

although O
he O

The O
point O
of O

was O
in O
the O
anterior O
axillary O

Examination O
of O
the O

revealed O
a O
nontender O
abdomen O
with O
a O
palpable O
liver O
edge, O
three O
fingerbreadths O
below O
the O
right O
costal O
margin. O
This O

No O

There O
were O
no O

A O

In O
summary O
Dr. O
Rodriquez O
is O
a O
77-year-old O
gentleman O
with O
a O
clear O
cut O
pulmonary O
hypertension. O
The O
etiology O
of O
this O
is O
not O
clear O
at O
the O
moment. O
Differential O
diagnosis O
could O
include O
chronic O
thromboembolic O
disease, O
occult O
underlying O
pulmonary O
disease O
(doubt), O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea, O
and O
collagen O
vascular O
disease. O
In O
addition O
some O
patients O
develop O
a O
marked O
pulmonary O
artery O
hypertension O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
stiff O
left O
ventricle O
even O
with O
preserved O
left O
ventricular O
function O
although O
this O
I O
think O
would O
be O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
exclusion. O
The O
degree O
of O
his O
edema O
is O
quite O
striking O
and O
I O
agree O
with O
increasing O
his O
diuretic O
regimen. O
I'm O
embarking O
on O
a O
course O
of O
evaluation O
to O
exclude O
the O
most O
likely O
causes. O
In O
specific O
he O
will O
be O
having O
a O

contrast O
to O
rule O
out O
chronic O

this O

Dear O

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Hannah O

in O
Internal O
Medicine O
today. O
She O
was O
seen O
alongside O
my O

Dr. O
Heidi O
Erik-Roy. O
As O
you O
know, O
she O
is O
a O
lovely O
52-year-old O
female O
in O
whom O
you O
have O
found O
a O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
surgery. O
She O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
perioperative O
risk O
assessment. O
Ms. O
Hendricks O
tells O
me O
that O
she O
has O
longstanding O
type DIABETES
1 DIABETES
diabetes, DIABETES
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
hyperlipidemia, HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease. O
She O
in O
fact O
has O
undergone O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafting O
in O
both O
her O
left O
and O
right O
lower O
extremities. O
Specifically, O
she O
is O
status O
post O
a O
right O
fem-pop O
bypass O
in O
2066 O
and O
a O
left O
fem-DP O
bypass O
also O
in O
2066. O
It O
appears O
that O
her O
right O
graft O
has O
been O
functioning O
well, O
but O
her O
left O
graft O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
occluded O
many O
years O
ago. O
She O
comes O
in O
now O
with O
a O
nonhealing O
ulcer O
and O
gangrene O
in O
her O
left O
toe. O
You O
have O
planned O
a O
redo O

for O
this O
upcoming O
Saturday. O
Ms. O
Hendricks O
tells O
me O
that O

and O
of O

for O
a O
hyperemic O
left O
foot O
with O
a O
bandage, O
which O
is O
covering O
what O
is O
reportedly O
a O
gangrenous O
toe. O
Her O
left O
lower O
extremity O
pulses O
are O
1+ O
in O
the O
femoral, O
absent O
popliteal O
and O
absent O
distal O
pulses. O
In O
her O
right O
lower O
extremity, O
she O
has O
1+ O
femoral, O
with O
no O
bruit, O
2+ O
popliteal, O
2+ O
DP O
and O
1+ O
PT. O
An O
EKG O
done O
in O
our O
clinic O
today O
demonstrates O
a O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
97 O
beats O
per O
minute O
with O
a O
left O
axis O
deviation. O
There O
is O
left O
atrial O
enlargement O
and O
Q-waves O
in O
V1 O
through O
V3 O
suggestive O
of O
an O
old O
anteroseptal O
MI. O
There O
are O
also O
Q-waves O
in O
lead O
III O
and O
aVF, O
which O
raises O
suspicion O
of O
an O
old CAD
inferior CAD
MI. CAD
In O
summary, O
Ms. O
Hendricks O
is O
a O
lovely O
52-year-old O
female O
with O
longstanding O
diabetes, O
hypertension, O
hyperlipidemia, O
and O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
who O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
perioperative O
risk O
assessment O
in O
light O
of O
an O
anticipated O
redo O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft. O
She O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
excellent O
functional O
capacity O
up O
until O
several O
months O
ago. O
However, O
I O
am O
concerned O
by O
her O
electrocardiogram, O
which O
raises O
the O
suspicion O
of O
underlying O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
given O
the O
findings O
of O
a O
probable CAD
inferior CAD
and CAD
old CAD
anteroseptal CAD
myocardial CAD
infarction. CAD
As O
such, O
I O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
better O
delineate O
her O
burden O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
by O
way O
of O
a O
stress O
test O
prior O
to O
her O
surgery. O
Given O
that O
her O
functional O
status O
has O
been O
so O
good O
up O
until O
recently, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
we O
need O
to O
delay O
her O
surgery. O
However, O
I O
would O
start O
her O
on O
a O
beta-blocker MEDICATION
and O
as O
such, O
I O
have O
given O
her O
a O
prescription O
for O
atenolol MEDICATION
25 O
mg O
once O
daily, O
which O
she O
will O
start O
today O
and O
continue O
up O
to O
and O
beyond O
the O
perioperative O
period. O
During O
the O
perioperative O
period, O
we O
would O
recommend O
that O
she O
has O
tight O
control O
of O
her O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
with O
a O
goal O
blood O
pressure O
less O
than O
120/80 O
and O
a O
goal O
heart O
rate O
less O
than O
60. O
I O
would O
also O
make O
sure O
to O
obtain O
a O
postoperative O
EKG O
to O
ensure O
there O
has O
not O
been O
any O
changes. O
We O
will O
try O
to O
arrange O
for O
an O
exercise O
test O
with O
arm O
ergometry O
and O
MIBI O
imaging O
for O
tomorrow O
morning. O
If O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
do O
arm O
exercise, O
we O
will O
obtain O
an O
adenosine O
MIBI. O
I O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
the O
results O
tomorrow O
after O
the O
study O
is O
performed. O
As O
I O
mentioned O
because O
her O
functional O
capacity O
is O
good, O
I O
do O
not O
anticipate O
that O
we O
will O
need O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
in O
the O
surgical O
scheduling O
based O
on O
the O
test O
results. O
This O
is O
more O
in O
order O
to O
give O
us O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
underlying CAD
burden CAD
of CAD
coronary CAD
artery CAD
disease. CAD
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
seeing O
Ms. O
Hendricks O
in O
clinic O
today. O
We O
are O
certainly O
available O
during O
the O
perioperative O
period O
if O
any O
cardiovascular O
issues O
are O
to O
arise. O
Please O
feel O
free O
to O
contact O
me O
with O
any O
questions. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Schmidt: O
Your SMOKER
patient, SMOKER
Hannah O
Hendricks, O
was O
in O
the O
Surgery O
Clinic O
today. O
As O
you O
know, O
she O
is O
a O
52-year-old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease. O
She O
underwent O
a O
redo O
left O
femoral O
to O
anterior O
tibial O
bypass O
graft O
using O
basilic O
and O
cephalic O
vein O
from O
her O
right O
arm O
on O
May O
3, O
2078. O
She O
has O
done O
well O
since O
the O
procedure. O
She O
is O
now O
comes O
here O
complaining O
of O
left O
foot O
pain. O
She O
had O
an O
ultrasound O
in O
the O
vascular O
lab O
to O
rule O
out O
a O
DVT, O
which O
it O
did. O
She O
explains O
the O
discomfort O
as O
pain O
and O
burning O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
foot O
as O
well O
as O
her O
arch O
and O
over O
the O
dorsum O
of O
the O
foot. O
On O
exam, O
she O
is O
a O
well O
appearing O
female O
in O
no O
acute O
distress. O
She O
is O
alert O
and O
oriented O
x3. O
She O
appears O
grossly O
neurologically O
intact. O
Her O
lower O
extremity O
exam O
reveals O
easily O
palpable O
bypass O
graft O
pulse O
in O
her O
left O
leg. O
Her O
left O
foot O
is O
warm O
and O
well O
perfused O
and O
she O
has O
a O
very O
small O
pinhole O
ulcer O
over O
the O
plantar O
aspect O
of O
her O
left O
great O
toe. O
This O
does O
not O
appear O
infected O
and O
I O
cannot O
probe O
to O
bone. O
It O
remains O
superficial. O
She O
has O
no O
other O
ischemic O
skin O
changes O
noted. O
I O
have O
discussed O
with O
Hannah O
that O
her O
discomfort O
most O
likely O
is O
due O
to O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
due O
to O
her O
diabetes. DIABETES
She O
also O
experienced O
this O
discomfort O
prior O
to O
her O
surgery. O
She O
is O
enquiring O
about O
starting O
Neurontin. O
I O
have O
said O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
try O
either O
Neurontin O
or O
Lyrica O
to O
help O
with O
the O
peripheral O
neuropathy. O
She O
will O
return O
next O
week O
for O
her O
postoperative O
graft O
scan O
to O
assess O
her O
circulation. O
She O
knows O
to O
contact O
us O
sooner O
if O
thing O
worsen. O
If O
I O
can O
be O
of O
further O
assistance O
in O
her O
care, O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me. O

EMERGENCY O
DEPARTMENT O
COURSE: O
The O
patient O
was O
seen O
and O
evaluated O
by O
me O
and O
the O
resident. O
I O
confirm O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
and O
evaluated O
the O
patient, O
reviewed O
the O
resident's O
documentation O
on O
the O
patient's O
chart, O
and O
discussed O
the O
evaluation, O
plan O
of O
care, O
and O
disposition O
with O
the O
patient O
as O
well O
as O
the O
resident. O
The O
patient O
had O
a O
CBC O
and O
metabolic O
panel. O
CBC O
showed O
white O
count O
of O
14 O
with O
shift. O
LFTs O
were O
within O
normal O
limits. O
X-ray O
of O
her O
left O
foot O
showed O
no O
osteomyelitis O
seen O
on O
x-ray O
and O
x-ray O
of O
her O
tib-fib O
continued O
to O
show O
no O
osteomyelitis. O
Given O
the O
erythema O
and O
swelling, O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
a O
cellulitis O
in O
this O
vasculopathic O
who O
was O
also O
diabetic O
and O
so O
we O
gave O
her O
a O
1 O
g O
of O
vancomycin O
(especially O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
has O
failed O
outpatient O
therapy O
with O
oral O
antibiotics) O
and O
we O
are O
admitting O
her O
to O
the O
Medicine O
Service O
for O
cellulitis. O
The O
patient's O
erythema O
and O
swelling O
does O
not O
extend O
to O
her O
foot O
and O
would O
be O
extremely O
atypical O
for O
a O
DVT. O
We O
also O
notified O
the O
Internal O
Medicine O
resident O
of O
the O
patient's O
admission O
to O
Medicine O
as O
she O
is O
followed O
closely O
by O
Surgery O
and O
this O
notification O
was O
made O
at O
8:30 O
p.m. O
Given O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
does O
not O
have O
osteomyelitis O
at O
this O
point O
we O
have O
not O
discussed O
the O
PICC O
line O
and O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
does O
not O
have O
any O
____ O
abnormalities, O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
she O
needs O
pressors O
or O
aggressive O
hydration O
and O
we O
are O
starting O
her O
on O
maintenance O
fluids, O
antibiotics, O
and O
admitting O
her O
to O
the O
hospital. O
DIAGNOSIS: O
Left O
lower O

presents O
to O
the O
KEKELA O

with O
complaints O
of O
body O
jerking O
since O
last O

The O
patient O
was O
in O
his O
otherwise O
good O
state O
of O
health O
when O
he O
went O
to O
his O
normal O
dialysis O
session O
yesterday. O
The O
session O
was O
uneventful, O
and O
he O
finished O
dialysis O
around O
7:30 O
pm. O
Around O
9 O
pm, O
he O
started O
noting O
un-controlable O
jerky O
movements O
of O
his O
jaw, O
arms, O
and O
legs. O
He O
was O
unable O
to O
stand O
by O
himself, O
and O
had O
difficulty O
with O
any O
motor O
activity. O
It O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
feed O
himself, O
and O
needed O
help O
from O
his O
wife O
to O
do O
so. O
The O
jerking O
continued O
throughout O
the O
night O
without O
getting O
better, O
and O
his O
daughter O
called O
his O
PCP's O
office O
today, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
was O
instructed O
to O
proceed O
to O
the O

He O
has O
had O
a O
similar O
episode O
like O
this O
before O
in O
January O
of O
2092, O
when O
he O
developed O
the O
exact O
same O
jerking O
movements O
after O
a O
long O
three O
day O
weekend O
when O
he O
went O
without O
dialysis O
(see O
note O
in O

by O

It O
was O
deemed O
at O
that O
time O
that O
his O
myoclonus O
was O
due O
to O
electrolyte O

and O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
EDUCARE-FARGO O
and O
received O

the O

I O
expect O

she O
needs O

I O
suggested O
she O

I O
gave O

All O

I O
explained O
at O
great O

the O

the O

she O
stopped O

She O
seemed O

that O
it O
would O
have O
such O
an O
immediate O
and O
strong O
effect O
and O
I O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
it O
does. O
She O
has O
to O
take O
her O
medication O
every O

I O
told O
her O
she O
had O

up O
a O

She O
states O
she O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
On O
physical O
examination, O
well-developed, O
well-nourished, O
well-groomed, O
normal O
mood O
and O
affect, O
but O
slightly O
anxious O
with O
movement, O
female O
in O
no O
acute O
distress O
at O
this O
time. O
On O
musculoskeletal O
examination O
of O
lumbar O
spine, O
flexion O
was O
within O
normal O
limits. O
Extension O
she O
had O
her O
type O
of O
pain O
at O
about O
10-20 O
degrees. O
Side-bending O
was O
unremarkable. O
On O
hip O
examination O
she O
had O
some O
decreased O
internal O
rotation O
on O
the O
right O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
left. O
Straight O
leg O
raise O
bilaterally O
was O
negative, O
however, O
supine, O
slight O
guarding O
on O
the O
right. O
Femoral O
stretch O
was O
positive O
on O
the O
right O
but O
not O
on O
the O
left. O
On O
neurological O
examination, O
as O
far O
as O
motor O
examination, O
there O
is O
some O
slight O
decrease, O
half O
a O
grade, O
quadriceps O
and O
hip O
flexors; O
however, O
this O
was O
functional; O
otherwise O
unremarkable O
on O
the O
right O
or O
the O
left. O
Her O
reflexes O
were O
2 O
plus O
in O
the O
achilles. O
Babinskis O
were O
downgoing, O
1 O
plus O
at O
the O
patella O
on O
the O
right, O
and O
2 O
plus O
on O
the O
left. O
Sensory O
examination O
slightly O
decreased O
at O
L3 O
on O
the O
right; O
however, O
normal O

otherwise, O
gait O
was O
antalgic O
on O
the O

did O
not O
want O
to O
bear O
weight. O
IMPRESSION: O
1. O
Right O
L3 O
acute O
radiculopathy O
secondary O
to O
herniated O
disk O
and O
facet O
arthropathy. O
2. O
Functional O
limitations O
secondary O
to O
pain, O
causing O
her O
functional O
weakness. O
RECOMMENDATIONS: O
1. O
Transforaminal O
epidural O
steroid O
injection O
at O
L3 O
and O
L4 O
on O
the O
right. O
2. O
Physical O
therapy O
after O
her O
injection. O
3. O
Continue O
her O
medications O
of O
Darvocet O
and O
Celebrex. O
4. O
Keep O
her O
out O
of O
work O
until O
she O
is O
able O
to O
receive O
the O
injection, O
as O
well O
as O
continue O
with O
her O
physical O
therapy O
to O
improve O
her O
strength, O
given O
her O
acute O
radiculopathy. O

to O
stop O
to O
catch O
her O
breath O
after O
walking O
up O
only O
4-5 O
steps O
in O
a O
stairwell. O
She O
finds O
it O
difficult O
to O
get O
started O
on O
her O
work O
because O
of O
fatigue. O
She O
has O
had O
a O
cough O
that O
initially O
produced O
yellowish, O
'slimy' O
sputum, O
but O
more O
recently O
has O
been O
dry. O
She O
notes O
occasional O
wheezing. O
She O
also O
noted O
muscle O
and O
joint O
pain O
involving O
the O
shoulders O
and O

extremities O
over O
the O
past O
5-6 O
months O
that O
she O
attributed O
to O
'arthritis'. O
No O
polyuria, O
but O

Appetite O
diminished O
and O
she O
lost O
about O
30 O
pounds. O
She O
noted O
a O
nodule O
on O
the O

of O
the O
left O
elbow O
that O
her O
PCP O
'cut O
into' O
recently. O
She O
has O
also O
noted O
a O
nodule O
on O
the O
dorsal O
surface O
of O
the O
right O
foot O
that O
seems O
to O
'get O
larger'. O
She O
experienced O
substernal O

There O
was O

Discussion: O
Sarcoidosis, O
until O
proven O
otherwise. O
She O
is O
obviously O
older O
than O
typical O
presentation O
of O
sarcoidosis, O
but O
she O
had O
previous O
lymphadenopathy O
that O
may O
have O
been O
a O
first O
presentation O
of O
the O
illness O
with O
spontaneous O
remission. O
The O
lung O
findings, O
systemic O
symptoms, O
hypercalcemia, O
anemia, O
abnormal O
serum O
ACE O
level O
are O
all O
suggestive O
of O
this O
diagnosis. O
Her O
hypercalcemia O
is O
symptomatic O
and O
should O
be O
treated O
with O
volume O
repletion. O
She O
should O
not O
receive O
diuretics O
at O
present. O
Long O
term O
treatment O
will O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
underlying O
diagnosis O
and O
its O
treatment. O
I O
think O
she O
will O
need O
corticosteroids O
for O
her O
sarcoidosis O
and O
I O
expect O
this O
will O
improve O
the O
hypercalcemia, O
but O
we O
need O
definitive O
diagnosis O
first. O
The O
cardiac O
murmur O
is O
impressive, O
but O
likely O
unrelated O
to O
the O
pulmonary O
disease. O
We O
need O
echocardiogram O
to O
better O
define O
valvular O
function. O
The O
minimally O
elevated O
troponins O
are O
not O
felt O
to O
be O
of O
clinical O
significance O
at O
this O
point. O
Appreciate O
Cardiology O
input O
on O
this O
finding. O
Suggest: O
1. O
Stop MEDICATION
HCTZ,avoid MEDICATION
diuretics O
until O
fully O
volume O
repleted. O
2. O
IV O
normal O
saline. O
May O
need O
rates O
in O
the O
150-200 O
range O
to O
control O
her O
hypercalcemia O
acutely, O
but O
she O
has O
had O
this O
for O
some O
time, O
so O
can O
be O
conservative O
with O
fluids O
approach. O
3. O
Agree O
with O
check O
PTH, O
vitamin O
D O
levels. O
4. O
Follow O
lytes, O
creatinine, O
calcium, O
Hct. O
5. O
Agree O
with O
check O
echocardiogram. O
6. O
We O
should O
ask O
the O
Pulmonary O
Service O
to O
see O
her O
in O
consultation. O
Bronchoscopy O
with O
biopsy O
may O
be O
the O
best O
way O
to O
obtain O
confirmatory O
tissue O
for O
diagnosis O
of O
sarcoidosis. O

of O
fatigue, O

during O
a O
work-up O
at O
her O
last O
admission O
to O
MEDIQUIK O
on O
6/2-6/20/97. O
At O
that O
time, O
the O
patient O
noted O
that O
3-4 O

In O
early O
May, O
she O
presented O
to O
the O
walk-in O
clinic O
with O
these O
complaints O
and O
a O
CXR O
showed O
increased O
interstitial O

and O
mediastinal O
lymphadenopathy O
subsequently O
confirmed O
by O
CT. O
A O
PET O
CT O
showed O
FDG O
avidity O
in O
multiple O
enlarged O
thoracic O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
at O
the O

concern O
was O
raised O
for O
multiple O
processes O
including O
sarcoid, O

was O
treated O
with O
IVF, O
lasix O
at O
times, O
and O
a O
dose O
of O

which O
led O
to O
a O

biopsy O
6/08/97 O
revealed O
non-specific O
follicular O
hyperplasia, O
though O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
a O

process. O
Oncology O
was O
consulted, O
and O
a O
lymphoma O
work-up O
was O
pursued; O
flow O

revealed O
polyclonal O
CD19+ O

CD8+ O
T O
cells, O
with O
no O

for O
a O

population. O
Repeat O
CT O
examination O
of O
the O
chest O
revealed O
no O
change O
in O
the O
bilateral O
axillary, O
mediastinal, O
and O
hilar O
lymphadenopathy O
and O
offered O
no O
further O
clues O
to O
diagnostic O
possibilities. O
The O
patient O
underwent O
pulmonary O
function O
testing, O
which O
showed O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
FEV1, O
FVC, O
and O
FEV1/FVC O
ratio; O
total O
lung O
capacity O
and O
subdivisions O
were O
normal, O
resistance O
and O
specific O
conductance O
were O
normal, O
and O
single O

capacity O
was O
reduced. O
On O
7/19/97, O
a O
bronchoscopy O
was O
attempted, O
but O
the O
patient O
was O
unable O
to O
tolerate O
the O
procedure, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
performed. O
Thoracic O
surgery O
was O
consulted O
and O
recommended O
that O
the O
patient O
be O
evaluated O
in O
the O
outpatient O
setting O
for O
biopsy O
under O
general O
anesthesia. O
Fungal O
antibodies O
were O
sent, O
and O
a O
trial O
of O
steroids O
was O
not O
attempted O
during O

acid O
reflux, O
saying O
only O
water O
goes O
down O
and O
a O
lack O
of O

with O
very O
dry O
mouth. O
She O
notes O
continued O
weight O
loss O
of O
15lbs O
since O
leaving O
the O
hospital, O
tolerating O
little O
more O
than O
1-2 O
cans O
of O
Ensure/day O
per O
her O
family. O
She O
further O
denies O
N/V, O
diarrhea, O
fever/chills/dizziness O
or O
recent O
infection. O
Of O
note, O
she O
has O
been O
drinking O
little, O
but O
urinating O
9-10 O
times O
a O
day, O
clear O
urine O
with O
large O
volumes. O
She O
has O
not O

for O
several O
days. O
She O
has O
continued O
her O
medications O
as O
instructed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge. O
In O
addition, O
her O
family O
notes O
a O
dramatic O
change O
in O
her O
mood O
and O
activity O
level O
since O
prior O
to O
hospitalization. O
She O
used O
to O
be O
very O
active, O
working O
nearly O
every O

and O
keeping O

relying O
on O
her O
children O
for O
help O
and O
awakening O
early O
in O

unintentionally. O
She O
has O
felt O
too O
tired O
to O
pursue O
her O
usual O
nightly O
bingo O
game. O
She O
denies O

The O
etiology O
of O
this O
pt&#8217;s O
lethargy O
is O
unclear. O
It O
is O
notable, O
however, O
that O
her O

very O
similar O
to O
her O
presentation O
in O
July O
at O
which O
time O
she O
was O
found O
to O
be O
bacteremic O
with O
an O
additional O
intra-abdominal O
bacterial O
collection. O
At O
present, O
there O
is O
no O
clear O
source O
of O

although O
her O
urinalysis O
is O
suspicious O
for O
a O

afebrile. O
In O
addition O
to O
bacteremia, O
UTI O
and O
re-accumulation O
of O
an O
intra-abdominal O
collection, O
other O
possible O
causes O
of O
her O

include O
toxic/metabolic O

CHIEF O
COMPLAINT: O
A O
57-year-old O
with O
back O
pain. O
HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
The O
patient O
is O
a O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
complicated O
past O
medical O
history, O
presents O
with O
a O
chronic O
history O
of O
low O
back O
pain, O
worse O
over O
the O
last O
week. O
She O
states O
that O
3 O
years O
ago, O
she O
had O
a O
motor O
vehicle O
accident. O
Since O
that O
time, O
has O
had O
chronic O
low O
back O
pain. O
She O
has O
been O
able O
to O
ambulate O
at O
home. O
Denies O
any O
fevers, O
rashes, O
history O
of O
urinary O
incontinence, O
weakness, O
or O
numbness. O
She O
went O
to O
EDUCARE-FARGO O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
was O
prescribed O
Percocet, O
comes O
here O
now O
because O
the O
patient's O
family O
and O
the O
patient O
would O
like O
to O
change O
her O
care O
to O
Lansing O
Dover O
Clinic. O
Denies O
any O
numbness O
or O
weakness. O
States O
that O
she O
is O
no O
longer O
taking O
her O
pills O
at O
home. O
Denies O
any O
suicidal O
or O
homicidal O
ideation, O
has O
a O
flat O
affect. O
Denies O
any O
depression. O
Her O
son, O
however, O
with O
whom O
she O
lives O
disagrees O
and O
is O
very O
concerned O
that O
she O
may O
be O
depressed. O
He O
is O
also O
very O
concerned O
that O
she O
is O
not O
taking O
her O
medicines O
and O
that O
she O
is O
not O
caring O
for O
herself O
well O
at O
home. O
PAST O
MEDICAL O
HISTORY: O
Remarkable O
for O

diabetes, DIABETES
and O
a O

SOCIAL O
HISTORY, O

AND O
REVIEW O
OF O
SYSTEMS: O
As O
per O
the O
written O
note. O
The O
patient SMOKER
was SMOKER
counseled SMOKER
regarding SMOKER
smoking SMOKER
cessation. SMOKER
MEDICATIONS: O
Hydrochlorothiazide MEDICATION
and O
Coumadin. O
ALLERGIES: O
None. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
The O
patient O
is O
awake O
and O
alert O
in O
no O
acute O
distress. O
Vital O
signs O
are O
within O
normal O
limits O
as O
documented. O
For O

findings, O
please O

Specifically, O
HEENT, O
neck, O
respiratory, O
cardiac, O
rectal, O
and O
abdominal O
exam O
are O
within O
normal O
limits O
as O
documented. O
Skin O
exam O
is O
remarkable O
for O
erythematous O
changes O
in O
the O
groin O
where O
the O
patient O
has O
significant O
skin O
fold O
due O
to O
obesity. O
Musculoskeletal O
exam O
is O
otherwise O
unremarkable. O
Range O
of O
motion O
is O
full. O
Strength O
and O
tone O
is O
normal. O
The O
patient O
does O
have O
a O
positive O
straight O
leg O
raise O
on O
the O
left, O
reproducing O
her O
back O
pain. O
Neurologically, O
the O
patient O
has O
a O
flat O
affect O
but O
is O
oriented O
with O
intact O
cranial O
nerves O
and O
no O
focal O
neurologic O
deficit O
in O
either O
motor O
or O
sensory O
distribution. O
She O
does, O
however, O
walk O
with O
a O
limp, O
which O
is O
chronic O
for O
her. O
LABORATORY O
DATA: O
White O
blood O

EMERGENCY O
DEPARTMENT O
COURSE: O
My O
chief O
concern O
for O
this O
patient O
is O
her O
inability O
to O
care O
for O
self O
at O
home. O
It O
is O
apparent O
that O
her O
son O
is O
interested O
in O
helping O
her O
and O
do O
so, O
but O
the O
patient O
on O
physical O
exam O
has O
some O
obvious O
lack O
of O
hygiene O
and O
I O
am O
concerned O
that O
potentially O
the O
patient O
has O
either O
an O
underlying O
neurologic O
or O
psychiatric O
issue O
that O
is O
preventing O
her O
from O
thriving O
at O
home. O
Psychiatry O
initially O
was O
consulted. O
Their O
impression O
was O
that O
the O
patient O
may O
have O
neuro O
behavior O
problem O
that O
needs O
further O
outpatient O
workup, O
and O
she O
was O
referred O
to O
a O
specific O
providers O
within O
the O
next O
2 O
weeks. O
The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
potassium O
chloride O
for O
her O
hypokalemia. O
Care O
coordinator O
and O
social O
services O
were O
consulted. O
The O
patient O
will O
have O
a O
home O
safety O
evaluation O
and O
will O
be O
referred O
for O
primary O
care O
services, O
was O
discharged O
with O
a O
cane O
for O
ambulation, O
and O
will O
likely O
also O
receive O
VNA O
Services O
to O

her O
with O
medication O

other O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O

she O
began O
to O
have O
intermittent O
burning O
pain O
of O
her O
feet O
and O
sometimes O
her O
lower O
legs/feet. O
This O
pain O
typically O
occurred O
on O
one O
leg O
more O
than O
the O
other, O
without O
an O

predominance O
of O
one O

In O
the O
past O

she O
has O
had O
continuous, O
bilateral O
burning O
pain O
that O
began O
in O
both O
feet. O
Several O
weeks O

her O
pain O
worsened O
considerably O
such O
that O
she O
was O
having O

Around O
this O
time, O
the O
pain O
spread O
up O
her O
legs O
to O
above O
her O
knees. O
She O
also O
noted O
having O

that O
her O
feet O
were O
swollen O
(she O
is O

her O
feet O
due O

Her O
pain O
continued O
to O
worsen O
until O
the O
night O
prior O
to O
admission, O
when O
she O
was O
in O
her O

found O
herself O
in O
such O

that O
she O
was O
unable O

COMPLAINT: O
Multiple O
acute O
and O
chronic O
medical O
issues, O
including O
subacute O
weight O
loss. O
IDENTIFICATION: O
This O
is O
my O
first O
medical O
visit O
with O
this O
75-year-old O
woman O
with O
multiple O
recent O
hospitalizations. O
HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
She O
has O
a O
long O
history O
of O
severe O
cerebrovascular O
disease, O
with O
multiple O
strokes. O
She O
has O
stenosis O
in O
both O
anterior O
and O
posterior O
circulation. O
Past O
right O
carotid O
endarterectomy. O
In O
August O
2095, O
she O
was O
admitted O
to O
BMH O
with O
a O
right O
cerebellar O
stroke, O
complicated O
by O
a O
brief O
intubation O
and O
pneumonia. O
She O
underwent O
stenting O
of O
her O
right O
vertebral O
artery O
and O
left O
common O
carotid O
artery. O
She O
had O
subsequent O
episodes O
of O
worsening O
speech, O
and O
was O
started O
on O
Coumadin, O
with O
an O
INR O
goal O
of O
2.5 O
to O
3.0. O
She O
is O
followed O
closely O
by O
Neurology O
and O
may, O
at O
some O
point, O
undergo O
further O
interventional O
radiology O
procedures, O
to O
be O
determined. O
During O
her O
most O
recent O
hospitalization O
she O
had O
some O
confusion O
which O
was O
attributed O
to O
low O
sodium. O
This O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
the O
result O
of O
osmotic O
diuresis, O
and O
possible O
SIADH. O
This O
is O
being O
treated O
with O
salt O
tablets, O
saline O
boluses O
in O
her O
G-tube, O
water O
restriction, O
and O
low-dose O
Lasix. O
No O
evidence O
of O
adrenal O
insufficiency. O
Since O
leaving O
the O
hospital, O
she O
has O
had O
ongoing O
weight O
loss. O
Baseline O
weight O
170 O
pounds. O
Weight O
in O
early O
September, O
167 O
pounds. O
Weight O
October O
20th, O
160 O
pounds. O
Weight O
&lt;PHI O
TYPE='DATE'&gt;November O
28th&lt;/PHI&gt;, O
141 O
pounds. O
Weight O
today O
in O
clinic O
146 O
pounds O
on O
our O
scale. O
She O
had O
a O
swallowing O
study O
on O
October O
26, O
2095, O
which O
revealed O
no O
aspiration, O
but O
very O
poor O
bolus O
formation. O
The O
G-tube O
was O
placed O
in O
August, O
and O
has O
healed O
well, O
but O
has O
never O
been O
used O
for O
daily O
tube O
feeds O
on O
an O
outpatient O
basis. O
Over O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
weeks, O
she O
has O
worsening O
trouble O
with O
coughing, O
choking O
and O
sputtering, O
as O
she O
attempts O
to O
swallow. O
Her O
caloric O
p.o. O
intake O
sounds O
as O
if O
it O
has O
been O
quite O
minimal, O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
ounces O
of O
potatoes O
or O
pureed O
foods O
here O
and O
there. O
She O
is O
drinking O
two O
or O
three O
can O
of O
booster O
Ensure O
daily, O
but O
clearly O
not O
meeting O
her O
caloric O
needs. O
Today's O

was O
with O
the O
patient, O
and O
her O
daughter O

The O

Another O

full-time. O
Visiting O

Previous O
to O
the O
last O
few O

the O
patient O
was O
fairly O
independent. O
PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION: O
GENERAL: O
Cachectic, O
anxious O
woman, O
who O
is O
slightly O

HEART: O
Regular O

No O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
1. O
Weight O
loss. O
Probably O
due O
to O
poor O
caloric O
intake. O
This O
is O
a O
significant O
health O
concern O
for O
her, O
as O
she O
has O
become O
progressively O
cachectic O
and O
weak. O
This O
is O
probably O
attributed O
to, O
by O
some O
extent, O
her O
progressive O
dysphagia. O
She O
is O
referred O
urgently O
to O
Nutrition, O
and O
will O
see O
them O
on O
Tuesday. O
I O
suggested O
to O
the O
daughter O
and O
to O
the O
nutritionist O
that O
we O
transition O
her O
to O
tube O
feeds O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks, O
to O
get O
her O
muscle O
mass O
up, O
and O
then O
reevaluate. O
She O
should O
continue O
to O
take O
p.o. O
foods O
as O
tolerated, O
but O
she O
needs O
to O
attempt O
to O
meet O
her O
caloric O
intake O
via O
the O
G-tube, O
since O
she O
is O
clearly O
not O
meeting O
it O
p.o. O
Will O
try O
Glucerna O
because O
of O
her O
diabetes O
history. O
The O
patient's O
daughter O
and O
the O
nutritionist O
are O
aware O
of O
her O
issues O
with O
vitamin O
K O
and O
Coumadin, O
and O
they O
will O
discuss O
this O
further O
when O
she O
sees O
Nutrition O
Clinic O
in O
two O
days. O
2. O
Cerebrovascular O

Followed O
closely O
by O
Neurology. O
No O

Will O
adjust O
Coumadin O
as O
advised O
by O

3. O
SIADH. O
I O
need O
to O
review O
these O
records O
more O
closely, O
and O
try O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
is O
no O
other O
underlying O
disorder. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
her O
sodiums O
have O
been O
quite O
good O
recently. O
4. O
Diabetes. O
Recent O
hyperglycemia, O
with O
sugars O
in O
the O

Most O
recently, O
with O
sugars O
in O
the O
100 O

over O
the O

goal O
is O
simply O
to O
maintain O
her O
sugars O
between O
120 O
and O
approximately O
220 O
to O
250. O
Once O
her O
dietary O
issues O
are O
stabilized, O
we O
can O
aim O
for O
slightly O
tighter O
control. O
Wish O
to O
avoid O
hypoglycemia, O
given O
her O
troubles O
with O
p.o. O
intake. O
5. O
Recent O
history O
of O
bright O
red O

Daughter O
will O
bring O
me O
her O
recent O

and O
we O
will O
take O
it O

6. O
Constipation. O
Continue O
Colace. O
Add O
Dulcolax O
PRN. O
Continue O
Fleet O

If O
she O
does O
have O
chronic O

this O
may O
impact O
her O
appetite O
and O
her O
ability O
to O
eat O
successfully. O
7. O
Hypertension. O
Currently O
in O
reasonable O
control. O
Goal O
BP O

Initial O
severe HYPERTENSION

this O
visit, O
attributed O
to O

which O
clearly O
is O
a O
major O
issue O
for O
her. O
Follow-up O
at O
next O
visit. O
8. O
Anxiety. O
Followed O
by O
Psychiatry. O
Extensive O
reassurance O
given O
today O
to O
the O
patient. O
She O
is O
very O
concerned O
about O
her O
weight O
loss, O
as O
am O
I. O
I O
tried O
to O
reassure O
her O
that O
we O
would O
take O
this O
seriously O
and O
address O
it O
in O
a O
very O
rapid O

No O

Her O

She O

her O

There O
is O
a O
hand O

deep O
purple O
bruise O
over O
the O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
Mechanical O
fall O
with O
laceration O
and O
bruising O
but O
no O
more O
serious O
complications. O
Fortunately O
she O
did O
not O
have O
intracranial O
bleeding. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
why O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
up, O
whether O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O
stress O
of O
the O
falls O
verses O
independent O
causes. O
Given O
that O
the O
high O
blood O
pressure O
has O
persisted, O
I O
will O
add MEDICATION
atenolol MEDICATION
12.5 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d., O
and O
discuss O
via O
phone O
or O
E-mail O
with O
her O
daughter O
next O
week O
to O
see O
how O
well O
this O
is O
working. O
Goal O
BP O
140-160 O
systolic. O
Her O
urine O
was O
checked O
today. O
Hematuria O
has O
resolved. O
She O
has O
2+ O
proteinuria. O
I O
will O
recheck O
this O
in O
a O
week O
or O
two O
after O
we O
treat O
her O
hypertension. O
We O
spent O
over O
half O
of O
today's O
45-minute O
visit O
discussing O
risks O
and O
benefits O
of O
Coumadin O
therapy. O
Although O
she O
is O
at O
risk O
for O
falls, O
she O
feels O
quite O
clearly O
that O
she O
prefers O
to O
be O
on O
the O
Coumadin O
due O
to O
her O
fear O
of O
having O
a O
repeated O
thrombotic O
stroke. O
She O
feels O
that O
she O
has O
not O
had O
any O
bleeding O
complications, O
and O
that O
she O
really O
would O
not O
like O
to O
suffer O
through O
another O
stroke. O
I O
explained O
that O
there O
was O
some O
risk O
with O
falls O
of O
intracranial O
hemorrhage O
and O
its O
consequences. O
I O
spoke O
with O
Dr. O
Dewitt O
last O
month O
about O
her O
Coumadin, O
and O
we O
both O
feel O
that O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
well O
in O
terms O
of O
stroke O
prevention, O
but O
that O
she O
is O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
falls. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
she O
is O
in O
a O
gray O
area O
with O
no O
clear O
right O
answer O
in O
terms O
of O
risk O
benefit O
analysis O
for O
Coumadin O
for O
her. O
She O
feels O
very O
strongly O
that O
she O
wishes O
to O
continue. O
This O
was O
discussed O
in O
detail O
with O
her O
and O
her O
daughter, O
and O
this O
probably O
is O
a O
reasonable O
decision. O
I O
encouraged O
her O
to O
restart O
physical O
therapy O
to O
work O
on O
her O
strength O
and O
hopefully O
diminish O
her O
risk O
of O
a O
subsequent O
fall. O
More O
than O
half O
of O
today's O
45-minute O
visit O
spent O
in O
patient O
counseling O
and O
education. O

Cognitively, O

her O

Impression: O
Betty O
is O
a O
78 O
year O
old O
woman O
with O
progressive O
cerebrovascular O
disease O
due O
to O
local O
radiation, O
plus O
diabetes, DIABETES
hypertension, O
hyperlipidemia. HYPERLIPIDEMIA
She O
is O
s/p O
left O
ICA O
stents O
and O
right O
VA O
angioplasty. O
Her O
most O
significant O
vascular O
lesion O
is O
stenosis O
proximal O
to O
the O
ICA O
stent, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
hint O
now O
of O
transient O
or O
orthostatic O
symptoms. O
My O
continued O
feeling O
is O
that O
we O
ought O
to O
focus O
on O
her O
controllable O
risk O
factors, O
such O
as O
diabetes, O
hypertension, O
hyperlipidemia, O
as O
you O
are O
doing. O
I O
understand O
you O
have O
recently O
been O
adjusting O
her O
antihypertensive O
regimen. O
I O
would O
recommend O
a O
goal O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
no O
lower O
than O
120 O
mmHg. O
I O
think O
a O
reasonable O
way O
to O
approach O
this O
is O
to O
use O
(1) O
her O
clinical O
status, O
and O
(2) O
'functional' O
imaging, O
such O
as O
Diamox O
SPECT, O
to O
follow O
her O
cerebrovascular O
disease. O
I O
think O
intervention O
would O
be O
warranted O
if O
there O
were O
a O
deterioration O
in O
one O
of O
these O
parameters. O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
heard O
from O
Howard O
Yelverton O
about O
his O
thoughts O
regarding O
the O
recent O
scan, O
but O
I O
did O
review O
the O
CT O
scans O
with O
neuroradiology. O
Our O
impression O
is O
that, O
while O
the O
wording O
of O
the O
reports O
seems O
to O
suggest O
significant O
progression O
of O
the O
LICA O
stenosis, O
it's O
not O
significant O
enough O
to O
prompt O
us O
to O
act, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
symptomatic O
or O
functional O
changes. O
I O
am O
ordering O
a O
Diamox O
SPECT O
scan, O
since O
the O
previous O
one O
was O
in O
July O
of O
last O
year. O
This O
is O
my O
last O
general O
neurology O
clinic O
at O
BMH; O
I O
will O
be O
a O
neuromuscular O
fellow O
here O
next O
year. O
While O
I O
can O
be O
available O
for O
questions O
or O
concerns, O
I O
will O
be O
referring O
Betty's O
care O
to O
one O
of O
the O
more O
junior O
residents. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
This O
61-year-old O
ambidextrous O
female O
is O
referred O
by O
Dr. O
Orellana O
for O
followup O
of O
possible O
stroke O
or O
TIA. O
The O
patient O
is O
interviewed O
and O
available O
records O
are O
reviewed. O
In O
February, O
she O
developed O
left O
leg O
weakness O
on O
arising O
one O
morning. O
There O
was O
also O
some O
possible O
ataxia O
of O
the O
left O
upper O
extremity O
with O
decreased O
control O
of O
both O
the O
arm O
and O
the O
leg. O
This O
seemed O
to O
occur O
for O
two O
days O
in O
a O
row O
and O
on O
one O
occasion, O
she O
fell O
getting O
out O
of O
bed. O
The O
symptoms O
resolved O
before O
she O
could O
be O
evaluated. O
She O
attributed O
the O
symptoms O
to O
not O
enough O
air O
pressure O
in O
her O
air O
mattress O
and O
once O
this O
was O
corrected, O
she O
feels O
that O
the O
event O
has O
not O
re-occured. O
The O
second O
event O
was O
apparently O
associated O
with O
some O
left O
facial O
weakness O
as O
well. O
She O
was O
seen O
by O
Neurology O
on O
02/10/43 O
after O
she O
was O
admitted. O
The O
history O
includes O
also O
lightheadedness O
and O
foggy O
vision O
per O
that O
report. O
Initially O
MRI O
of O
the O
head O
showed O
no O
acute O
events O
but O
did O
show O
a O
change O
in O
the O
right O
posterior O
cerebral O
artery O
and O
a O
lesion O
in O
the O
left O
temporal O
lobe. O
Also, O
in O
the O
record O
is O
noted O
that O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
second O
event, O
her O
glucose O
was O
very O
low O
at O
around O
32 O
and O
symptoms O
resolved O
after O
treatment O
with O
D50. O
There O
was O
also O
further O
history O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
seeing O
a O
chiropractor O
for O
treatment O
of O
neck O
pain O
in O
the O
several O
months O
leading O
up O
to O
the O
event. O
On O
examination O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission, O
there O
were O
no O
clear O
findings. O
MRI O
was O
said O
to O
show O
periventricular O
white O
matter O
changes. O
The O
area O
of O
abnormality O
adjacent O
to O
the O
left O
lateral O
ventricle O
was O
thought O
to O
perhaps O
represent O
an O
old O
prior O
small O
hemorrhage. O
MRA O
of O
the O
brain O
showed O
absence O
of O
visualization O
of O
the O
right O
PCA O
about O
1 O
cm O
beyond O
its O
origin O
but O
MRA O
of O
the O
neck O
showed O
no O
significant O
changes. O
Subsequent O
echocardiogram O
showed O
mild O
LVH O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
shunt. O
Currently, O
the O
patient O
is O
asymptomatic O
and O
presents O
for O
routine O
followup. O
It O
has O
been O
unclear O
what O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
symptoms O
was. O
Some O
have O
attributed O
the O
symptoms O
to O
hypoglycemia O
and O
another O
formulation O
was O
that O
of O
a O
thalamic O
TIA O
given O
the O
changes O
in O
the O
right O
PCA O
on O
MRA. O
Another O
consideration O
was O
dissection O
from O
manipulation O
by O
the O
chiropractor. O
There O
is O
no O
clinical O
history O
to O
go O
with O
the O
possible O
old O
small O
hemorrhage. O

The O

does O

in O

this O

There O
is O
some O

of O

it O
appears O

There O
is O
no O

NEUROLOGICAL O
TESTING: O
Mental O

is O
essentially O
normal O
to O

There O
is O
no O
facial O

but O
there O
is O
a O
mild O

that O
did O
not O
look O
pathological. O
Visual O

IMPRESSION: O

neurologic O
symptoms, O
question O
etiology. O
Comment. O
I O
would O
agree O
with O
prior O
examiners O
that O
the O
symptoms O
probably O
do O
not O
relate O
to O
the O
position O
of O
the O
bed O
or O
air O
in O
the O

mattress. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
the O
symptoms O
are O
approximate O
enough O
to O
the O
chiropractic O
manipulation O
to O
be O
relevant. O
Symptoms O
could O
have O
related O
to O
hypoglycemia O
or O
could O
have O
been O
vascular O
in O
nature. O
In O
this O
regard, O
the O
PCA O
stenosis O
or O
occlusion O
may O
be O
relevant. O
It O
is O
not O
immediately O
clear O
how O
to O
fit O
in O
the O
old O
hemorrhage. O
PLAN: O
Although, O
she O
should O
be O
on O
some O
type O
of O
antiplatelet O
agent. O
She O
was O
on O
aspirin MEDICATION
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
event O
and O
therefore O
would O
be O
considered O
an O
aspirin O
failure. O
We O
therefore O
suggested O
Plavix O
75 O
mg O
daily. O
We O
were O
subsequently O
called O
by O
the O
pharmacy O
and O
informed O
that O
she O
is O
already O
on O
Aggrenox. O
It O
probably O
does O
not O
matter O
which O
medication O
she O
chooses; O
however, O
she O
should O
be O
on O
one O
or O
the O
other O
and O
not O
both. O
For O
treatment O
of O
the O
homocysteine O
level O
elevation, O
we O
have O
added O
simply O
multivitamins O
two O
daily. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
significant O
this O
finding O
is O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
above O
symptoms. O
She O
is O
advised O
to O
watch O
her O
glucose O
level O
and O
adjust O
medicines O
accordingly. O
We O
have O
suggested O
a O
followup O
in O
Neurology O
in O
six O
months. O

w/ O
multiple O
medical O
problems, O
including O
dCHF, O
restrictive O
lung O
disease, O
severe O
polyarthritis O
returns O
to O
clinic O
doing O
significantly O
better O
for O
the O
most O
part. O
Regarding O
her O
shortness O
of O
breath, O
she O
undewent O
a O
stress O
test O
which O
was O
completely O
wnl. O
She O
has O
also O
lost O
some O
weight O
(intentional) O
and O
states O
that, O
although O
she O
still O
gets O
short O
of O
breath O
with O
exertion, O
it O
is O
noticeably O
better. O
She O
is O
being O
followed O
by O
the O
pulmonary O
department O
and O
is O
under O
consideration O
for O
a O
cardiopulmonary O
exercise O
test. O
For O
her O
cough, O
the O
nexium O
has O
helped O
a O
lot O
and O
she O
likely O
has O
sig O
reflux O
despite O
the O
negative O
esophagram. O
The O
weight O
loss O
is O
probably O
helping O
with O
the O
gerd O
as O
well. O
Regarding O
her O
arthritis, O
he O
L O
shoulder O
pain O
is O
much O
improved O
with O
PT. O
Her O
biggest O
complaint O
at O
the O
moment, O
though, O
is O
her O
low O
back O
pain. O
She O
was O
seen O
in O
pain O
clinic O
for O
two O
injections. O
She O
states O
that O
the O
injections O
may O
have O
helped O
for O
1-2 O
days O
but O
then O
the O
pain O
returned. O
She O
says O
this O
is O
her O
most O
limiting O
symptom. O
She O
is O
begging O
for O
narcotics. O
Lastly, O
she O
has O
clear O
stress O
urinary O
incontinence, O
was O
cleared O
for O

pauses, O
and O
describes O
a O
'restless O
sleep', O

only O
relatively O
recently O
(over O
the O
last O
five O
months, O
particularly O
after O
12/26 O
of O
last O
year). O
She O
has O
described O
marked O
increased O
daytime O
sleepiness. O
She O
essentially O
describes O
a O
nocturnal O
sleep O
pattern O
which O
involves O
'sleeping O
around O
the O
clock' O
during O
which O
time O
she O
may O
initiate O
sleep O
between O
12:30 O
and O
1:00 O
a.m., O
and O
after O
a O
couple O
awakenings, O
will O
wake O
up O
at O
10:00 O
a.m., O
only O
to O
demonstrate O
frequent O
and O
often O
prolonged O
daytime O
naps O
of O
four O
hours O
duration. O
The O
patient O
states O
she O
will O
waken O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
and O
then O
reinitiate O
sleep O
for O
an O
additional O
four O
hours. O
She O
states O
that O
she O
is O
so O
tired O
that O
she O
can O
'fall O
asleep O
right O
after O
breakfast'. O
She O
then O
would O
get O
up O
for O
lunch O
and O
then O
go O
right O
back O
to O
sleep O
and O
sustain O
sleep O
until O
3:00 O
p.m. O
in O
the O
afternoon. O
Ms. O
Mckee O
also O
demonstrates O
a O
history O
of O

initiated O
at O
3 O

and O
was O
initially O
started O
on O

She O
later O
switched O
to O
Dilantin O
therapy, O
but O
more O
recently O
and O
particularly O
since O
the O
mid O
10's, O
she O
has O

No O
obvious O
cranial O
nerve O
deficits O
are O
appreciated. O
No O
focal O

neurologic O
deficits O
are O
noted. O
No O
significant O
appendicular O
dystaxias O
or O

are O
currently O
in O
evidence. O
The O
routine O
gait O
appears O
to O
be O
normal O

are O
present. O
No O
acute O
evidence O
of O
'microsleeps' O
are O
noted. O
On O
HEENT O
examination, O
there O
is O
evidence O
of O
a O
small O

IMPRESSION: O
1. O
Hypersomnia O
(780.54): O
Likely O
to O
be O
a O
result O
of O
frequent O
sleep O
disordered O
breathing O
events O
and O
their O
associated O
arousals. O
Other O
diagnostic O
possibilities O
include O
the O
presence O
of O
gastroesophageal O
reflux O
associated O
arousals O
as O
well O
as O
nocturnal O
sleep O
disruptions O
due O
to O

3. O
Seizure O
disorder: O
Recent O
literature O
suggests O
that O
there O
is O
a O
possible O
association O
between O
treatment O
of O
obstructive O
sleep O
disorder O
and O
increased O
seizure O
frequency O
in O
patients O
who O
are O
susceptible; O
i.e., O
thereby O
giving O
a O
further O
impetus O
for O
regular O
ongoing O
home O
CPAP O
therapy. O
PLAN: O
1. O
Suggest O
regular O
home O
CPAP O
administration O
(CPAP O
Mallinckrodt; O

humidification; O
at O
12 O
cm O

pressure). O
2. O
Pending O
clinical O
response, O
will O
reassess O
the O
patient's O
level O
of O
alertness, O
decrease O
amount O
of O
early O
morning O
awakenings, O
and O
possibly O
decrease O
seizure O
frequency O
at O
the O
next O
sleep O
study O
evaluation O
in O
12-14 O
weeks O
times. O
3. O
In O
addition, O
patient O
is O
advised O
to O
continue O
efforts O
at O
weight O
reduction, O
use O
of O
an O
oro-dental, O
and/or O
potential O
ENT O
surgical O
approaches O
may O
also O
help O
to O
improve O

RE: O
Xavier O
Olive O
Dear O
Michael, O
Mr. O
Xavier O
Olive O
presents O
for O
evaluation, O
thanks O
for O
your O
referral. O
As O
you O
recall O
he O
is O
a O
71-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
is O
status O
post O
angioplasty O
on O
the O
left O
for O
high-grade O
stenotic O
lesions O
of O
the O
distal O
superficial O
femoral O
artery O
and O
the O
popliteal O
artery O
on O
the O
left. O
The O
patient O
presents O
now O
for O
further O
evaluation O
of O
his O
'claudication O
symptoms'. O
The O
patient O
states O
he O
has O
bilateral O
lower O
extremity O
symptoms, O
there O
are O
about O
equivalent O
in O
nature. O
He O
has O
very O
minimal O
low O
back O
pain. O
He O
states O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
getting O
worse O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
some O
abnormal O
gait. O
He O
states O
on O
a O
bad O
day O
its O
about O
a O
9/10 O
and O
even O
on O
a O
good O
day O
sometimes O
it O
can O
be O
as O
high O
as O
8-9/10. O
The O
episodes O
are O
almost O
daily O
and O
are O
brought O
on O
by O
things O
like O
walking. O
He O
can O
walk O
less O
than O
one O
block O
at O
which O
point O
he O
has O
lateral O
calf O
burning O
and O
at O
times O
notes O
some O
slow O
shuffling O
and O
occasionally O
falling. O
When O
he O
is O
having O
severe O
symptoms O
he O
notes O
his O
legs O
to O
be O
weak. O
He O
denies O
any O
bowel O
or O
bladder O
abnormalities O
of O
late, O
but O
has O
a O
historic O
of O
a O
chronic O
UTI O
secondary O
to O
his O
benign O
prostatic O
hypertrophy. O
He O
has O
very O
little O
back O
pain O
associated O
with O
his O
symptomatology. O
He O
has O
had O
no O
physical O
therapy O
to O
date O
and O
no O
spinal O
injections. O
He O
describes O
his O
general O
health O
as O
poor, O
but O
when O
specially O
asked O
he O
states O
it O
is O
because O
he O
his O
71 O
and O
has O
a O
history O
of O
hypertension. HYPERTENSION
Years O
ago O
he O
stated O
he O
was O
in O
excellent O
health. O
His O
weight O
is O

and O
also O

History: O
Mr. O
Xavier O
Olive O
is O
a O
73-year-old O
gentleman O
who O
comes O
into O
Trumbull O
Memorial O
Vascular O
Center O
for O
a O
second O
opinion O
regarding O
his O
lower O
extremity O
discomfort O
and O
also O
his O
progressive O
difficulty O
walking O
and O
maintaining O
balance. O
His O
referring O
physician O
is O
Dr. O
Ximena O
Keane, O
practicing O
out O
of O
Alexandria O
Clinic. O
Mr. O
Olive O
also O
heard O
about O
the O
TMH O
VC O
through O
TV O
advertisements. O
He O
is O
73 O
years O
old, O
has O
history O
of O
diabetes DIABETES
starting O
in O
2135, O
known O
history O
of O
peripheral O
artery O
disease O
with O
claudication O
and O
calf O
discomfort, O
for O
which O
he O
has O
previously O
seen O
Dr. O
Cain O
at O
Alexandria O
Clinic, O
and O
also O
has O
been O
evaluated O
and O
treated O
at O
the O
Corcoran O
District O
Hospital. O
Specifically, O
he O
describes O
having O
been O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Cain O
and O
others O
some O
three O
or O
four O
years O
ago, O
and O
undergoing O
at O
least O
two O
procedures, O
all O
related O
to O
his O
legs O
cramping O
up. O
He O
received O
prior O
stenting O
to O
his O
right O
common O
iliac O
artery O
and O
his O
left O
superficial O
femoral O
artery, O
so O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell. O
The O
stents O
were O
placed O
at O
Pomeroy O
Care O
Center O
(Big O
Rapids, O
AC) O
and O
also O
he O
had O
evaluation O
at O
the O
Corcoran O
District O
Hospital, O
and O
may O
have O
had O
a O
stenting O
procedure O
or O
revascularization O
procedure O
there. O
The O
patient O
and O
his O
wife O
are O
somewhat O
unclear O
about O
the O
dates O
and O
locations O
and O
times, O
but O
he O
does O
state O
that O
the O
treatments O
apparently O
did O
not O
help O
him O
at O
all. O
Currently, O
he O
has O
discomfort O
in O
both O
calves O
when O
he O
walks O
too O
far O
or O
too O
fast, O
and O
this O
stops O
him O
at O
about O
50 O
yards. O
The O
issue O
was O
complicated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
has O
had O
progressive O
parkinsonian-type O
symptoms, O
walking O
in O
a O
shuffle, O
tipping O
forward, O
and O
occasionally O
even O
falling O
forward O
and O
losing O
his O
balance O
completely. O
His O
legs O
are O
rubbery, O
and O
he O
does O
even O
realize O
that O
he O
is O
falling O
forward O
when O
it O
happens. O
It O
is O
worse O
when O
he O
is O
carrying O
things O
that O
weigh O
anything. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
his O
calves O
do O
cramp O
up O
in O
a O
typical O
fashion O
consistent O
with O
claudication, O
and O
he O
has O
known O
peripheral O
artery O
disease. O
Also O
feels O
though O
his O
hips O
sometimes O
are O
cramping O
up. O
The O
patient O
feels O
quite O
disabled O
by O
his O
symptoms, O
especially O
as O
a O
gentleman O
who O
was O
active O
and O
never O
had O
physical O
problems O
of O
this O
nature. O
Again, O
there O
is O
some O
degree O
of O
blurring O
between O
the O
parkinsonian O
symptoms O
and O
his O
claudication, O
as O
to O
which O
is O
truly O
causing O
his O
disability. O
Past O
medical O
history: O
Diabetes, DIABETES
onset O
in O
2135. O
Parkinsonian-type O

which O
he O

Data: O

Assessment O
and O
plan: O
Lower O
extremity O
arterial O
disease O
(PAD)-the O
patient O
clearly O
has O
history O
of O
PAD O
with O
prior O
interventions O
on O
both O
sides. O
Currently, O
complains O
of O
symptoms O
that O
sound O
like O
claudication, O
predominantly O
involving O
the O
calves O
on O
both O
sides, O
right O
slightly O
ahead O
of O
the O
left, O
and O
I O
would O
not O
be O
surprised O
if O
he O
has O
significant O
focal O
obstructive O
disease O
along O
the O
length O
of O
his O
iliac O
of O
SFA. O
Since O
his O
ABIs O
are O
well O
preserved O
at O
rest, O
I O
suspect O
he O
does O
not O
have O
pre-occlusion O
of O
the O
SFA, O
for O
example. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
he O
does O
have O
diabetes O
and O
his O
ABIs O
may O
be O
falsely O
elevated. O
His O
major O
limitation O
is O
due O
to O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
claudication O
that O
occurs O
less O
than O
50 O
yards O
and O
stops O
him O
at O
that O
point, O
and O
the O
gait O
disturbance O
that O
he O
has O
related O
to O
his O
movement O
disorder, O
possible O
Parkinson's O
disease. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
latter O
entity O
has O
been O
well O
enough O
defined, O
and O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
we O
have O
him O
see O
a O
neurologist O
here O
to O
better O
ascertain O
the O
nature O
of O
that O
disease, O
and O
as O
to O
whether O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
available O
in O
the O
way O
of O
treatment. O
1. O
As O
far O
his O

it O
would O
be O
extremely O
helpful O
to O
obtain O

the O

to O
better O
define O
what O
procedures O
were O
actually O
performed O
and O
where O
stents O
were O
placed. O
Given O
that O
it O
has O
been O
a O
year O
or O
more O
since O
his O
last O
intervention, O
it O
is O
likely O
he O
will O
need O
another O
angiographic O
study O
(or O
MRA/CTA) O
in O
order O
to O
ascertain O
the O
nature O
of O

developed O
diarrhea O
while O
in O
the O
hospital. O
After O
discharge, O
he O
continued O
to O
have O
profuse O
diarrhea, O
and O
was O
treated O
with O
IV O
hydration O
and O
metronidazole O
C. O
diff O
infection, O
first O
found O
to O
be O
positive O
on O
7/31/77. O
Since O
then O
he O
has O
had O
multiple O
episodes O
of O
recurrent O
C. O
diff. O
Most O
recently, O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
NAMG O
for O
treatment O
of O
recurrent O
C. O
diff O
in O
1/77, O
with O
improvement O
after O
receiving O
inpatient O
vancomycin O
and O
flagyl, O
and O
discharged O
to O
NAMG, O
where O
he O
was O
for O
3 O
weeks. O
He O
received O
21 O
days O
of O
flagyl. O
After O
about O
two O
weeks, O
he O
noticed O
a O
gradual O
increase O
in O
his O
stool O
frequency. O
Three O
weeks O
prior O
to O
admission, O
he O
began O
taking O
500 O
mg O
PO O
Flagyl O
q8h, O
which O
he O
had O
at O
home. O
He O
felt O
that O
his O
symptoms O
were O
improved O
somewhat O
on O
the O
flagyl. O
One O
week O
ago, O
he O
saw O
his O
PCP, O
where O
a O
C. O
diff O
stool O
toxin O
was O
negative. O
At O
that O
point, O
he O
stopped O
the O
PO O
flagyl, O
and O
shortly O
afterward O
his O
diarrhea O
again O
progressively O
worsened. O
Currently O
he O
is O
having O
10 O
BM O
per O
day, O
and O
he O
states O
that O
they O
are O
similar O
to O
odor, O
color, O
and O
frequency O
to O
his O
prior O
C. O
diff O
episodes. O
He O
has O
also O
had O
a O
few O
days O
of O
lower O
abdominal O
pain, O
2-3/10, O
with O
no O
clear O

and O
noticed O
a O
few O
flecks O

RE: O

Dear O
Harry O
and O
Yair: O
My O
thanks O
for O
your O
kind O
referral O
of O
the O
above O
noted O
patient O
with O
respect O
to O
her O
disabling O
claudication O
and O
of O
course O
she O
is O
not O
in O
a O
very O
happy O
circumstance. O
As O
you O
know, O
she O
is O
just O
52 O
years O
of O
age. O
Her O
cardiovascular O
risk O
factors O
include O
type DIABETES
2 DIABETES
diabetes DIABETES
treated O
with O
metformin MEDICATION
and O
Glyburide, MEDICATION
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
hyperlipidemia HYPERLIPIDEMIA
and O
she O
is O
a O
former SMOKER
cigarette SMOKER
smoker SMOKER
but O
she O
has O
not SMOKER
smoked SMOKER
in SMOKER
a SMOKER
year. SMOKER
She O
spends O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
caring O
for O
her O
partially O
disabled O
husband. O
She O
has O
known O
and O
impressive O
history O
of O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease. O
She O
has O
undergone O
bilateral O
leg O
revascularizations. O
On O
the O
left O
side O
initially O
an O
iliac O
stent O
was O
tried O
but O
in O
January O
of O
2063 O
she O
had O
a O
left O
iliofemoral O
endarterectomy O
with O
angioplasty O
and O
in O
situ O
above O
knee O
left O
fem-pop O
bypass O
graft. O
This O
reconstruction O
is O
functioning O
well, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
pulse O
examination O
and O
she O
certainly O
does O
not O
have O
any O
major O
symptoms O
in O
the O
left O
side. O
In O
April O
of O
2063 O
she O
had O
a O
right O
common O
femoral O
and O
external O
iliac O
endarterectomy O
with O
a O
right O
fem-pop O
bypass O
graft O
to O
the O
above-knee O
popliteal O
artery O
using O
transposed O
greater O
saphenous O
veins. O
There O
had O
previously O
been O
a O
right O
iliac O
PTA O
and O
stent. O
She O
states O
that O
the O
procedure O
in O
the O
right O
leg O
was O
only O
transiently O
of O
benefit. O
By O
last O
spring, O
i.e. O
a O
year O
ago O
she O
again O
had O
rather O
limiting O
claudication. O
She O
says O
this O
is O
now O
worse O
over O
the O
past O
several O
months O
and O
she O
quantifies O
this O
as O
severe O
calf O
pain O
after O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
blocks. O
Importantly O
she O
does O
not O
have O
ischemic O
rest O
pain O
and O
she O
has O
never O
had O
tissue O
loss. O
Recently O
resting O
ABIs O
were O
recorded O
at O
0.46 O
on O
the O
right O
and O
0.8 O
on O
the O
left. O
Her O
continued O
complaints O
led O
to O
a O
repeat O
arteriogram O
last O
October O
documenting O
a O
superficial O
femoral O
artery O
occlusion O
(??? O
length O
thereof O
- O
she O
did O
not O
bring O
the O
films O
themselves) O
and O
a O
patent O
albeit O
small O
reconstituted O
above-knee O
popliteal O
artery O
with O
decent O
runoff. O
Understandably O
Dr. O
Adcock O
was O
reluctant O
about O
recommending O
further O
revascularizations. O
She O
has O
sought O
an O
opinion O
here O
in O
this O
regard. O
She O
has O
no O
known O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
and O
her O
general O
system O
review O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
prior O
hospitalization O
in O
2061 O
for O
severe O
pancreatitis O
requiring O
laparotomy. O
On O
physical O
examination O
blood O
pressure O
was O
140/80. O
Pulse O
was O
70 O
and O
regular. O
Carotid O
upstroke O
was O
normal O
and O
there O
were O
no O
major O
carotid O
bruits. O
She O
has O
femoral O
pulses O
on O
both O
sides O
and O
the O
left O
fem-pop O
bypass O
graft O
in O
situ O
is O
palpable, O
as O
is O
the O
left O
popliteal O
pulse. O
There O
is O
no O
right O
popliteal O
nor O
right O
foot O
pulse. O
She O
does O
have O
dependent O
rubor O
on O
that O
right O
side O
although O
there O
is O
no O
tissue O
breakdown. O
This O
is O
of O
course O
a O
very O
unhappy O
situation. O
Further O
attempts O
at O
surgical O
revascularization O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
having O
both O
greater O
saphenous O
veins O
harvested O
and O
so O
forth O
is O
really O
not O
justified O
for O
claudication O
alone O
since O
the O
result O
can O
be O
anticipated O
to O
be O
not O
very O
good. O
However O
I O
am O
not O
absolutely O
ruling O
this O
out. O
I O
would O
suggest O
the O
following. O
Her O
risk O
factor O
control O
is O
decent O
and O
she O
should O
certainly O
stay O
on O
the O
Lipitor, MEDICATION
aspirin MEDICATION
and O
Plavix. MEDICATION
Since O
her O
problem O
is O
claudication O
I O
would O
like O
Yair O
to O
institute O
Pletal O
at O
full O
dosages O
and O
give O
this O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
before O
we O
can O
say O
that O
she O
has O
had O
an O
adequate O
trial O
with O
question O
benefit. O
She O
will O
get O
the O
actual O
arteriogram O
from O
the O
October O
study O
to O
me. O
If O
it O
seems O
reasonable O
and O
the O
right O
superficial O
femoral O
artery O
block O
is O
not O
too O
long O
an O
attempt O
at O
percutaneous O
recanalization O
could O
be O
considered. O
I O
will O
get O
back O
to O
you O
after O
review O
of O
the O
films O
themselves. O
My O
thanks O
once O
again. O

that O
day O
for O
trauma O
to O
the O

Had O
a O
negative O
CT O

and O
had O
an O

as O
she O
complained O
of O
some O
hip O
pain. O
Both O
studies O
were O
negative. O
Patient O
was O
then O
sent O

yesterday, O
after O
noticing O
a O
swollen O
tongue O
and O
some O
difficulty O
swallowing. O
Patient O
was O
immediately O
told O
to O
stop O
both O
her O
Roxicet O

Monopril MEDICATION
and O
was O
treated O
for O

Today O
patient O

no O
further O
throat O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS: O
This O
is O
a O
72-year-old O
right-handed O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
hypertension, HYPERTENSION
diabetes, DIABETES
and O
hypercholesterolemia HYPERLIPIDEMIA
who O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Service O
on O
06/18/2067 O
with O
right-arm O
weakness O
and O
difficulty O
speaking. O
She O
presented O
to O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
5.5 O
hours O
after O
last O
seeming O
normal. O
Her O
initial O
NI O
stroke O
scale O
was O
11. O
She O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Service O
for O
a O
stroke O
workup. O
Her O
imaging O
studies O
showed O
a O
left O
MCA O
infarct O
involving O
the O
left O
corona O
radiata, O
head O
of O
the O
caudate O
basal O
ganglia, O
and O
an O
MI O
cutoff O
on O
the O
CTA O
and O
MRA O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
left O
ICA O
occlusion. O
She O
was O
taken O
to O
angiogram O
for O
interventional O
neuroradiology. O
She O
had O
an O
angiogram. O
Radiology O
felt O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
access O
the O
cause O
and O
no O
intervention O
was O
attempted O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neuro O
ICU O
for O
blood O
pressure O
monitoring O
and O
hypertensive O
therapy. O
She O
remained O
stable O
anti-coagulated O
on O
heparin. O
During O
the O
hospital O
stay, O
she O
spontaneously O
converted O
to O
rapid O
ventricular O
rate O
atrial O
fibrillation, O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
the O
likely O
source O
of O
her O
stroke O
and O
as O
such O
was O
planned O
to O
remain O
anti-coagulated. O
She O
was O
discharged O
to O
rehab O
and O
subsequently O
went O
home O
from O
rehab O
on O
08/04/2067. O
At O
home, O
she O
had O
been O
noted O
to O
have O
elevations O
in O
blood O
pressure O
but O
has O
been O
feeling O
O.K. O
VNA O
sees O
her O
once O
a O
week. O
At O
rehab, O
for O
unclear O
reasons, O
her O
warfarin O
was O
discontinued O
and O
in O
speaking O
to O
the O
discharging O
physician O
from O
the O
Tracy O
Medical O
Clinic, O
this O
was O
done O
for O
a O
question O
of O
vaginal O
bleeding O
although O
the O
patient O
is O
unaware O
of O
any O
such O
problems. O
She O
continues O
to O
get O
PT O
and O
occupational O
therapy O
twice O
per O
week O
and O
complains O
that O
her O
memory O
remains O
poor. O
According O
to O
the O
family O
member O
and O
her O
daughter O
who O
are O
here O
interpreting O
for O
her O
at O
Clinic O
today, O
she O
continues O
to O
have O
right-sided O
weakness, O
although O
significantly O
improved O
and O
decreased O
verbal O
output O
although O
her O
daughter O
seemed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
communicate O
well O
with O
her. O
Since O
her O
discharge, O
she O
has O
not O
had O
any O
new O
episodes O
of O
numbness, O
weakness, O
headaches, O
or O
visual O
changes. O

IMAGING O
DATA: O
Initial O
head O
CT O
on O
06/18/2067 O
did O
not O
show O
any O
acute O
stroke O
or O
hemorrhage. O
On O
the O
CT, O
there O
was O
a O
question O
of O
a O
left O
MI O
cutoff. O
CT O
angiogram O
also O
showed O
a O
distal O
left O
ICA O
stenosis O
with O
minimal O
distal O
interflow. O
MRI O
of O
the O
brain O
showed O
a O
left O
MCA O
infarction O
involving O
the O
left O
corona O
radiata, O
head O
of O
the O
caudate O
basal O
ganglia. O
She O
has O
had O
mild O
to O
moderate O
chronic O
small O
vessel O
ischemic O
changes O
on O
her O
MRI. O
Echo O
showed O
a O
normal O
EF O
of O
55% O
without O
any O
clot, O
no O
PFO. O
IMPRESSION: O
This O
is O
a O
73-year-old O
woman O
with O
significant O
vascular O
risk O
factors, O
including O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
a O
left O
ICA O
MCA O
clot O
resulting O
in O
a O
left O
MCA O
territory O
infarct. O
On O
exam, O
she O
has O
residual O
aphasia O
involving O
both O
comprehension O
and O
fluency; O
and O
a O
moderate O
right O
hemiparesis. O
It O
is O
unclear O
to O
me O
why O
the O
warfarin O
was O
discontinued O
but O
given O
her O
stroke O
and O
the O
documentation O
of O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
during O
her O
hospital O
stay, O
I O
think O
that O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
anti-coagulation O
therapy. O
I O
have O
asked O
her O
to O
get O
a O
follow O
up O
PCP O
evaluation O
at O
the O
OCH O
to O
determine O
if O
indeed O
there O
are O
any O
contraindications O
to O
anti-coagulation. O
If O
there O
are O
no O
such O
contraindications, O
she O
should O
restart O
on O
warfarin. O
In O
addition, O
her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
still O
not O
well O
controlled O
and O
I O
would O
ask O
her O
to O
increase O
her O
Captopril O
to O
12.5 O
mg O
t.i.d. O
and O
to O
maintain O
a O
blood O
pressure O
diary. O
RECOMMENDATIONS: O
1. O
Continue O
anti-hypertensive O
and O
increase O
Captopril O
to O
12.5 O
mg O
t.i.d. O
2. O
Blood O
pressure O
diary O
for O
next O
clinic O
appointment. O
3. O
Continue O
risk O
factor O
modification O
with O
the O
management O
of O
blood O
pressure, O
diabetes, O
and O
hypercholesterol O
as O
she O
is O
doing. O
4. O
PCP O
evaluation O
for O
question O
of O
bleeding O
problem O
during O
rehab O
stay O
and O
resumption O
of O
warfarin O
if O
there O
are O
no O
contraindications O
per O
the O
PCP. O
5. O
Continue O
physical O
therapy O
and O
occupation O
therapy O
for O
gait O
training O
and O
language O
rehab. O
6. O
Return O
to O
clinic O
in O
6 O
months O
or O
sooner O
if O
there O
are O
any O
new O
problems. O
More O
than O
50% O
of O
this O
clinic O
visit O
was O
spent O
on O
patient O
education O
and O
counseling. O

The O
patient O
was O

INITIAL O
IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN: O
The O
patient O
is O
a O
76-year-old O
female O
with O
history O
of O
prior O
stroke, O
hypertension, O
diabetes, O
and O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation, O
who O
presents O
with O
altered O
mental O
status O
and O
urinary O
incontinence. O
Differential O
diagnosis O
at O
this O
time O
includes O
infectious O
versus O
a O
metabolic O
abnormality. O
The O
patient O
has O
no O
new O
deficits O
on O
neuro O
exam O
as O
per O
the O
family O
and O
as O
per O
review O
of O
prior O
notes. O
Repeat O
stroke O
is O
certainly O
on O
the O
differential, O
however, O
I O
have O
a O
lower O
suspicion O
then O
for O
a O
metabolic O
or O
infectious O
etiology. O
The O
patient O
will O
need O
to O
have O
a O
large O
workup O
including O
laboratory O
studies, O
urine O
studies, O
Foley O
catheter, O
portable O
chest O
x-ray, O
and O
repeat O
noncontrast O
head O
CT O
scan. O
EMERGENCY O
DEPARTMENT O
COURSE: O
Upon O
arrival O
to O
the O
Emergency O
Department, O
the O
patient O
had O
history O
and O
physical O
exam O
performed. O
The O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
in O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
rapid O
ventricular O
response. O
The O
patient's O
12-lead O
EKG O
revealed O
a O
rate O
of O
166 O
beats O
per O
minute, O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
rapid O
ventricular O
response, O
stable O
T-wave O
inversions O
noted O
over O
the O
lateral O
leads O
as O
well O
as O
over O
the O
precordial O
leads. O
No O
definite O
ST O
segment O
abnormalities O
were O
noted. O
The O
patient O
then O
had O
a O
portable O
chest O
x-ray O
and O
as O
per O
report, O
the O
patient's O
portable O
chest O
x-ray O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
acute O
cardiopulmonary O
process O
or O
findings. O
The O
patient O
did O
have O
a O
noncontrast O
head O
CT O
scan O
and O
the O
patient's O
noncontrast O
head O
CT O
scan O
was O
notable O
for O
some O
right-sided O
edema. O
The O
patient O
will O
have O
this O
followed O
up O
with O
an O
MRI O
of O
the O
brain. O
The O
patient's O
laboratory O
studies O
were O
notable O
for O
sodium O
of O
131 O
and O
potassium O
of O
5.2. O
The O
patient's O
lactic O
acid O
was O
1.7. O
The O
patient's O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
was O
not O
elevated. O
The O
patient O
was O
not O
anemic. O
The O
patient's O
urinalysis O
was O
consistent O
with O
infection. O
The O
patient's O
first O
set O
of O
cardiac O
markers O
were O
negative. O
The O
patient's O
coagulation O
studies O
were O
normal. O
The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
ceftriaxone O
for O
her O
urinary O
tract O
infection. O
The O
patient O
could O
possibly O
have O
urosepsis O
given O
her O
fever O
and O
tachycardia. O
Urine O
sepsis O
is O
my O
leading O
diagnosis O
at O
this O
time. O
The O
patient's O
right-sided O
edema O
is O
certainly O
concerning, O
however, O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
that O
the O
patient O
will O
need O
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
Neurology O
at O
this O
time. O
The O
patient O
will O
be O
admitted O
to O
medicine O
for O
presumed O
urosepsis. O
The O
patient O
will O
need O
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
a O
monitor O
bed. O
The O
patient's O
blood O
pressure O
is O
normal, O
and O
as O
such, O
I O

with O

and O
subsequent O

of O

4th O
metatarsals. O
She O
developed O
a O
chronic O
ulcerated O
callus O
over O
her O
R. O
lateral O
metatarsal O
heads, O
with O
underlying O
osteomyelitis&#8212;this O
did O
not O
improve O
despite O
multiple O
courses O
of O
antibiotics. O
She O
underwent O
I+D O
of O
her O
R. O
foot O
ulceration O
in O
12/89, O
OR O
cultures O
grew O
P. O

In O
3/90, O
she O
underwent O
debridement O
of O
her O
chronic O
R. O
lateral O
plantar O
ulceration O
and O
skin O
grafting. O
In O
6/90, O
she O
underwent O
deep O
debridement O
of O
her O
ongoing O
5th O
metatarsal O
osteomyelitis, O
along O
with O
excision O
of O
her O
5th O
metatarsal&#8212;bone O
cultures O
grew O
MSSA. O
She O
did O
well O
until O
2/92, O
when O
she O
underwent O
R. O
ankle O
revision O
for O
an O
equinovarus O
deformity O
of O
her O
R. O
hindfoot O
(calcaneal O
osteotomy, O
lateral O
translation, O
dorsiflexion O
first O
metatarsal O
osteotomy, O
and O
Achilles O
lengthening). O
She O
subsequently O
developed O
a O
R. O
heel O
ulceration, O
and O
in O
4/92, O
underwent O
debridement O
of O
this O
ulceration, O
removal O
of O
a O
screw, O
and O
placement O
of O
a O
vacuum O
sponge. O
Her O
wound O
continued O
to O
heal O
poorly, O
and O
she O
underwent O
R. O
SFA O
to O
posterior O
tibial O
bypass O
grafting. O
In O
7/92, O
she O
underwent O
debridement O
of O
her O
R. O
heel O
wound O
and O
placement O
of O
a O
full O
thickness O
skin O
graft, O
which O
has O
taken O
well; O
she O
feels O
that O
her O
R. O
heel O
has O
been O
healing O
nicely. O
During O
her O
long O
hospitalization O
in O
4/92, O
she O
started O
developing O
L. O
heel O
and O
L. O
forefoot O
ulcerations. O
She O
attributes O
the O
heel O
ulcerations O
to O
chronic O
pressure O
from O
her O
position O
in O
bed, O
and O
the O
forefoot O
ulcerations O
to O
the O
boots O
that O
were O
used O
to O
relieve O
her O
heel O
pressure, O
which O
apparently O
abraded O
her O
forefoot O
chronically. O
These O
ulcerations O
continued O
to O
worsen O
over O
the O
next O
few O
months, O
and O
she O
presented O
with O
cellulitis O
of O
this O
area O
in O
8/92. O
She O
received O
vancomycin, O
levofloxacin, O
flagyl O
initially, O
then O
augmentin, O
with O
persistent O
poor O
healing O
of O
her O
wounds. O
On O
9/10, O
she O
underwent O
operative O
debridement O
of O
her O
L. O
plantar O
heel O
ulcer&#8212;she O
was O
found O
to O
have O
extensive O
necrotic O
yellow-brown O
tissue O
underlying O
her O
L. O
heel O
eschar, O
which O
was O
extensively O
debrided; O
she O
received O
a O
course O
of O
linezolid O
postoperatively. O
She O
had O
an O
angiogram O
on O
9/12, O
which O
showed O
no O
significant O
flow O
limiting O
lesions O
in O
her O
LLE, O
and O
good O
flow O
through O
her O
prior O
R. O
SFA O
to O
posterior O
tibial O
bypas O
graft. O
She O
feels O
that O
her O
wounds O
have O
been O
healing O
fairly O
well O
recently; O
she O
feels O
that O
her O
R. O
heel O
is O
almost O
completely O
healed, O
and O
that O
her O
L. O
heel O
ulcer O
is O
smaller O
than O
it O
was O
previously. O
Her O
L. O
forefoot O
ulcer O
is O
also O
more O
shallow O
than O
it O
was O
in O
the O
past. O
Over O
the O
past O
2-3 O
days, O
she O
developed O
fairly O
acute O
swelling, O
erythema, O
and O
pain O
around O
her O
forefoot O
ulcer, O
with O
erythema O
spreading O
to O
the O
dorsal O
surface O
of O
her O
foot. O
She O
was O
seen O
in O

clinic, O
and O
was O
admitted O
for O

and O
further O
debridement. O
She O

in O

Pt O

to O
verbalize O
her O
insulin O
doses O
and O
states O
that O
she O
would O
prefer O
to O
continue O
with O

Suspect O
that O

are O
contributing O
to O
hyperglycemia, O
therefore O
reluctant O
to O
change O
insulin O
doses O
since O
IV O
fluids O
will O
likely O
stop O
later O

While O
in O

need O
to O
monitor O

more O
closely, O
but O
anticipate O
that O

can O
continue O
as O

Recommendations O
1. O
Continue O
with O
insulin O
pump. O
Instructed O
pt O
that O
she O
must: O
a. O
report O
all O
pre-meal O
bolus O
doses O
to O
the O
RN O
so O
that O
it O
can O
be O
documented O
on O
the O
flow O
sheet. O
b. O
have O
blood O
glucoses O
checked O
as O
ordered O
using O
the O
hospital O
approved O
glucose O
meter. O
c. O
alert O
RN O
if O
she O
feel O
uncomfortable O
using O
insulin O
pump. O
RN O
should O
page O
HO O
and/or O
diabetes O
dept O
immediately O
for O
orders O
for O
SC O
insulin. O
d. O
agree O
to O
discontinue O
insulin O
pump O
and O
start O
SC O
insulin O
if O
deemed O
necessary O
by O
house O
staff. O
Pt O
agrees O
to O
all O
of O
the O
above. O
2. O
Monitor O
blood O
glucoses O
at O
least O
before O
all O
meals O
and O
at O
bedtime. O
Please O
also O
check O
blood O
glucoses O
with O
any O
symptoms O
of O
hypoglycemia O
or O
at O
pt's O
request. O
Be O
sure O
to O
record O
these O
values O
on O
the O
daily O
flow O
sheet. O
3. O
For O
procedure O
today, O
I O
spoke O
with O
Kathryn O
Kincaid O
and O
asked O
that O
blood O
glucoses O
be O
monitored O
hourly O
while O
in O
cath O
lab O
unless O
BG O
is O
less O
than O
140. O
If O
BG O
less O
than O
140, O
monitor O
blood O
glucoses O
every O
30 O
minutes. O
Treat O
BG O
less O
than O
80 O
with O
1/2 O
amp O

and O
continue O
to O
monitor O
as O
described O

Do O
not O
remove O

returns O

followup O
of O
cerebrovascular O
disease. O
A O
lot O
has O
happened O
since O
I O
last O
saw O
him O
in O
10/2119. O
A O
CTA O
revealed O
severe O
stenosis O
of O
his O
left O
ICA. O
He O
is O
status O
post O
bilateral O
carotid O
endarterectomies O
and O
also O
has O
known O
vertebral O
disease O
with O
a O
history O
of O
a O
left O
occipital O
stroke. O
He O
subsequently O
was O
referred O
to O
Dr. O
Mccarthy O
and O
was O
scheduled O
to O
undergo O
left O
ICA O
stent O
placement O
in O
December. O
In O
November O
1 O
morning O
after O
going O
to O
the O
bathroom O
he O
developed O
sudden O
onset O
of O
vertigo. O
His O
wife O
called O
911. O
He O
continued O
to O
have O
positional O
vertigo O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
such O
that O
if O
he O
sat O
up O
he O
would O
become O
very O
vertiginous O
and O
off O
balance O
but O
if O
he O
laid O
with O
his O
eyes O
closed. O
He O
felt O
better. O
He O
was O
found O
to O
be O
orthostatic O
and O
his O
symptoms O
improved O
according O
to O
the O
chart O
by O
the O
next O
day O
though O
according O
to O
the O
patient, O
it O
took O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
for O
his O
symptoms O
to O
improve O
significantly. O
An O
MRI O
of O
the O
brain O
was O
unrevealing O
for O
ischemia. O
Although O
he O
significantly O
improved O
he O
still O
feels O
&#34;a O
little O
off O
balance&#34;. O
He O
is O
fine O
when O
he O
is O
sitting O
but O
he O
notes O
when O
he O
stands O
up O
he O
just O
&#34;feels O
off&#34;. O
He O
does O
not O
feel O
acutely O
vertiginous O
and O
does O
not O
have O
any O
sense O
of O
movement O
but O
does O
not O
feel O
as O
steady O
as O
he O
used O
to O
on O
his O
feet. O
He O
has O
seen O
Guy O
in O
physical O
therapy O
and O
is O
working O
on O
balance O
therapy. O
He O
subsequently O
did O
undergo O
left O
ICA O
stent O
placement O
on O
12/22/2119 O
without O
any O
complication. O
There O
was O
no O
worsening O
of O
his O
sense O
of O
imbalance O
or O
no O
new O
neurologic O
symptoms. O
Also O
of O
note, O
I O
neglected O
to O

that O
when O
he O
became O

is O
no O
response O
of O
her O
heart O
rate O
to O
mild O
calisthenics O
in O
the O
bed. O
Laboratories O
are O
notable O
for O
normal O
BUN O
to O
creatinine O
ratio O
of O
23/1.2 O
with O
a O
potassium O
of O
4.1 O
and O
a O
hematocrit O
of O
35%. O
Initial O
cardiac O
biomarkers O
were O
negative. O
In O
summary, O
Karson O
Uhrich O
is O
a O
73-year-old O
woman O
with O
hypertension O
and O
dyslipidemia O
who O
presents O
with O
a O
three-day O
history O
of O
presyncope O
and O
weakness O
in O
the O
context O
of O
a O
new O
diagnosis O
of O
2:1 O
AV O
block. O
Review O
of O
previous O
electrocardiograms O
reveals O
no O
right O
bundle-branch O
block O
and O
left O
anterior O
fascicular O
block O
and O
of O
late O
this O
represents O
progression O
of O
her O
underlying O
conduction O
system O
disease. O
We O
will O
proceed O
to O
permanent O
temporary O
pacemaker O
implantation O
for O
backup O
support O
and O
will O
arrange O
electrophysiologic O
consultation O
for O
permanent O
pacemaker O
implantation. O
There O
is O
no O
history O
to O
suggest O
an O
ischemic O
syndrome, O
so O
I O
did O
not O
think O
additional O
pharmacologic O
stress O
test O
is O
necessary. O
Her O
beta-blocker O
will O
be O
held O
overnight O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
amitriptyline O
to O
see O
if O
this O
facilitates O
recovery O
of O
her O
AV O
nodal O
function. O
Overall, O
I O
think O
this O
likely O
represents O
infra-hisian O
block O
and O
a O
pacemaker O
should O
be O
curative O
therapy. O
Additional O
plans O
will O
be O
dictated O
by O
her O
clinical O
course. O

septic O
arthritis O
(10/87 O

11/87) O
who O
presented O
1/19 O
s/p O
fall. O
With O
regards O
to O
his O
shoulder, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
know O
whether O
his O
infection O
was O
cured O
by O
the O
4-week O
abx O
course. O
Though O
his O
shoulder O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
grossly O
infected O
on O
exam, O
2 O
months O
after O
completion O
of O
his O
course, O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
determine O
sterilization O
of O
the O
shoulder O
on O
a O
clinical O
basis. O
The O
MRI O
is O
difficult O
to O
interpret, O
and O
may O
well O
reflect O
prior O
inflammatory O
changes. O
He O
did O
have O
persistently O
elevated O
inflammatory O
markers O
(though O
confounded O
by O
multiple O
comorbidities). O
Given O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
had O
cleared O
the O
infection, O
our O
plan O
as O
of O
the O
clinic O
visit O
Wednesday O
had O
been O
to O
observe O
him O
clinically, O
off O
abx, O
for O
signs O
of O
recurrent O
infection. O
However, O
given O
his O
fall O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
new O
hardware O
placement, O
would O
now O
favor O
a O
more O
aggressive O
workup O
of O
his O
shoulder. O
As O
such, O
would O
recommend O
shoulder O
aspiration O
off O
antibiotics. O
The O
source O
for O
the O
L O
shoulder O
staph O
infection O
was O
never O
elucidated, O
and O
blood O
cultures O
were O
negative. O
However, O
such O
septic O
arthritis O
often O
results O
from O
hematogenous O
seeding, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
small O
change O
that O
his O
R O
hip O
may O
also O
have O
become O
infected. O
This O
could O
help O
to O
explain O
the O
prosthesis O
loosening. O
Alternatively, O
he O
may O
have O
had O
hardware O
mechanical O
failure O
in O
setting O
of O
falls, O
or O
less O
likely O
involvement O
by O
his O
prostatic O
ca O
(?read O
of O
granulomatous O
disease O
around O
the O
prosthesis). O
Recommendations: O
-hold O
antibiotics, O
including O
pre-operative O
prophylactic O
antibiotics O
to O
allow O
optimal O
culture O
data O
-Aspirate O
shoulder. O
Send O
fluid O
for O
cell O
counts, O
Gram O
stain, O
aerobic/anaerobic/fungal O
cultures O
-if O
do O
not O
see O
contraindication O
to O
proceeding O
with O
planned O
hip O
replacement O
-would O
obtain O
hip O
biopsies O
in O
the O
OR, O
again O
off O
abx, O
to O
assess O
for O
possible O
hip O
infection O
-likewise, O
would O
send O
OR O
hip O
specimen O
to O
pathology O
to O
assess O
for O
infection O
vs. O
neoplastic O
involvement O
-check O
CK, O
given O

following O
fall, O
and O
possible O

well O
as O

On O
physical O
examination, O
she O
is O
a O
small O
lady O
in O
no O
acute O
distress. O
The O
neck O
veins O
are O
flat. O
The O
extraocular O
movements O
are O
full. O
There O
are O
no O
symptoms O
of O
hyperthyroidism. O
The O
chest O
is O
clear O
to O
auscultation. O
The O
heart O
sounds O
are O
regular. O
There O
are O
no O
rubs O
or O

The O
lower O
extremities O
are O
free O
of O

and O
now O
her O
toes O
are O
free O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN: O
A O
76 O
year O
old O
woman O
with O
a O
past O
history O
of O
hyperthyroidism, O
which O
was O
treated O
with O
I-131 O
with O
good O
results O
who, O
last O
year O
before O
she O
left O
the O
country, O
had O
a O
subnormal O
TSH. O
She O
does O
not O
have O
obvious O
symptoms O
of O
hyperthyroidism O
but O
today O
I O
have O
obtained O
a O
repeat O
TSH O
as O
well O
as O
T3 O
and O
T4. O
Diabetes DIABETES
continues O
to O
be O
a O
problem. O
Glycemic O
control O
continues O
to O
be O
difficult O
to O
achieve. O
Today, O
I O
have O
reinstated MEDICATION
metformin MEDICATION
at O
500 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
The O
son O
is O
going O
to O
check O
on O
the O
medications O
to O
make O
certain O
that O
indeed O
she O
is O
not O
taking O
this O
medicine O
at O
this O
point. O
The O
other O
medications O
were O
continued. O
It O
is O
indeed O
possible O
that O
she O
will O
need O
insulin O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
I O
plan O
close O
followup O
and O
will O
see O
her O
again O
in O
six O
weeks' O
time. O
If O
she O
is O
hyperthyroid, O
this O
may O
also O
explain O
the O
difficulty O
in O
achieving O
glycemic O
control. O
Against O
this O
is O
the O
high O
cholesterol. O
She O
used MEDICATION
to MEDICATION
be MEDICATION
on MEDICATION
Lipitor, MEDICATION
which O
was O
discontinued O
during O
her O
trip O
to O
Ghana. O
I O
have O
reinstated MEDICATION
the MEDICATION
Lipitor MEDICATION
today O
20 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
I O
have O
also O
added O
a O
small O
dose O
of O
enalapril MEDICATION
2.5 O
mg O
p.o. O
q.d. O
to O
protect O
her O
kidneys O
even O
though O
she O
is O
not O
hypertensive. O
